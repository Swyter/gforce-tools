The Filelist [extractor script](gforce_filelistbin.1sc) should support any game that uses version 7, that is:
* *Athens 2004* (reportedly uses v6 in some versions)
* *Spyro: A Hero's Tail*
* *Robots*
* *Predator: Concrete Jungle*
* *Batman Begins*
* *Ice Age 2: The Meltdown*
* *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* (the classic variant, not the Xenon/PS3 next-gen version)
* *The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor*
* *007: Quantum of Solace*
* *Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs*
* *G-Force*
* *Dead Space: Extraction*
* *Spider-Man 4 (cancelled prototype)*
* *GoldenEye 007*

The only difference between Filelist v6 and v7 is that the filenames are scrambled.
