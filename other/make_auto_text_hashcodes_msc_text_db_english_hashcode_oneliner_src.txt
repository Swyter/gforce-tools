`0x43003df1`; `Now than's... cool.`
`0x43003df2`; `Okay, that one is stopped cold!`
`0x43003df3`; `Now to keep moving before that one melts.`
`0x43003df4`; `And like that. It's stopped... Nice!`
`0x43003df5`; `Ya know... this is kinda fun!`
`0x43003df6`; `That one's done... for now!`
`0x43003df7`; `Wonder how long it will stay like that? Don't think I'll stick around and see.`
`0x43003df8`; `Now let's see how you play together.`
`0x43003df9`; `Time to sow some discord!`
`0x43003dfa`; `Let's see what this does now!`
`0x43003dfb`; `Let's watch them take each other out!`
`0x43003dfc`; `This is gonna be helpful!`
`0x43003dfd`; `Transport is transport, right?`
`0x43003dfe`; `Now this is fun!`
`0x43003dff`; `All set for the shootout at the appliance corral!`
`0x43003e00`; `Get this... it still is a light!`
`0x43003e01`; `We need one of these back at HQ!`
`0x43003e02`; `Gotta love the space age!`
`0x43003e03`; `Now that's protection big time!`
`0x43003e04`; `Now it's time to... dish it out!`
`0x43003e05`; `That satellite dish has my back!`
`0x43003e06`; `No question - satelitte has it way over cable!`
`0x43003e07`; `Now this is the way to clean.`
`0x43003e08`; `Ready to clean up this place.`
`0x43003e09`; `Who knew a vacuum could be so versatile?`
`0x43003e0a`; `I'm on the vacuum and ready to go!`
`0x43003e0b`; `Now all I need is a nice dirty rug.`
`0x43003e0c`; `Now this should be interesting.`
`0x43003e0d`; `Okay, even playing field now.`
`0x43003e0e`; `Two of us can play the bad appliance game.`
`0x43003e0f`; `This could be very helpful.`
`0x43003e10`; `Saberlizing... the only way to fly!`
`0x43003e11`; `Okay, now for step two.`
`0x43003e12`; `Hm, I do love this Saberlizer.`
`0x43003e13`; `Let's all see what happens next!`
`0x43003e14`; `Now that was cool!`
`0x43003e15`; `Think I could use one of these back in HQ!`
`0x43003e16`; `BAM! Do I have aim or what?`
`0x43003e17`; `It didn't see that one coming.`
`0x43003e18`; `That should buy me a few precious seconds.`
`0x43003e19`; `ZAP! And you are out... for now at least!`
`0x43003e1a`; `Oh, it does not like that!`
`0x43003e1b`; `Now this is a useful weapon!`
`0x43003e1c`; `I do believe I am on a roll.`
`0x43003e1d`; `Did you guys see that one? Sweet, hm?`
`0x43003e1e`; `Hit it where it hurts!`
`0x43003e1f`; `There we go! And it's out... for now at least.`
`0x43003e20`; `No web... but it sure does have legs.`
`0x43003e21`; `That's just wrong!`
`0x43003e22`; `I'll never bother another real spider ever again!`
`0x43003e23`; `So many legs. Least I have some targets!`
`0x43003e24`; `A computerized spider. What won't they think of next?`
`0x43003e25`; `Ouch. Lost a few hairs there!`
`0x43003e26`; `Whoa, that hurt!`
`0x43003e27`; `Anyone see a sprinkler nearby?`
`0x43003e28`; `Now that's hot!`
`0x43003e29`; `Ow, that was not fun!`
`0x43003e2a`; `Getting mighty cold here!`
`0x43003e2b`; `All iced up!`
`0x43003e2c`; `Big chill in the room team.`
`0x43003e2d`; `The fur helps... a little!`
`0x43003e2e`; `Now I could really use a flamethrower!`
`0x43003e2f`; `Arfgggh!... cough!`
`0x43003e30`; `Uh, what is that stuff?`
`0x43003e31`; `I can't breathe that stuff!`
`0x43003e32`; `This is worse than a furball!`
`0x43003e33`; `Now that smells really bad!`
`0x43003e34`; `Hey. Just got zapped here.`
`0x43003e35`; `Now this is dangerous!`
`0x43003e36`; `One more zap and I am in trouble big time!`
`0x43003e37`; `That was a bad move!`
`0x43003e38`; `I think I'm starting to glow, and not in a good way!`
`0x43003e39`; `I'm caught in the bubble!`
`0x43003e3a`; `Now this is a close shave!`
`0x43003e3b`; `Ya know... I didn't get training for this kind of a problem!`
`0x43003e3c`; `I always thought shaving was a bad idea!`
`0x43003e3d`; `A bubble... and the word sounds so harmless!`
`0x43003e3e`; `Whoa, slippery slope ahead!`
`0x43003e3f`; `Hey, I can't walk on this!`
`0x43003e40`; `Arrrrgh... the floor just turned real slick, team!`
`0x43003e41`; `Gotta stay away from that stuff!`
`0x43003e42`; `I'm moving. Just not in the direction I want to go!`
`0x43003e43`; `Sticky situation!`
`0x43003e44`; `This is gonna slow me down.`
`0x43003e45`; `I think I'm stuck... for real!`
`0x43003e46`; `Wished I had dodged that goo!`
`0x43003e47`; `This will really mess with my fur!`
`0x43003e48`; `I'm toast if that thing get its way.`
`0x43003e49`; `Heat just got turned up a bit here!`
`0x43003e4a`; `Whew! Getting way too warm!`
`0x43003e4b`; `I'd pull the plug on this toaster... if I saw one!`
`0x43003e4c`; `What I wouldn't give for a loaf of sliced bread...`
`0x43003e4d`; `Cornered by a vacuum here!`
`0x43003e4e`; `It’s me against the vacuum, team!`
`0x43003e4f`; `Looks like I'm cornered!`
`0x43003e50`; `Now I definitely need a plan B!`
`0x43003e51`; `I never want to see a vacuum again.`
`0x43003e52`; `Advantage to the appliances, I'm afraid. Got to turn it around.`
`0x43003e53`; `In trouble here guys.`
`0x43003e54`; `Oh that wasn't good...`
`0x43003e55`; `I'm still in it guys... for now.`
`0x43003e56`; `Got to turn this around.`
`0x43003e57`; `No way am I lying down here!`
`0x43003e58`; `Okay, can't let the hits distract me. but it's getting hard...`
`0x43003e59`; `No way - they can't be that good!`
`0x43003e5a`; `Down to my last hand team. `
`0x43003e5b`; `Ahhh... not looking good at all here...`
`0x43003e5c`; `Wish I had some skates!`
`0x43003e5d`; `Things just turned slippery here.`
`0x43003e5e`; `My paws move. Just not where I point them!`
`0x43003e5f`; `Any more ice and I won't be able to get anywhere!`
`0x43003e60`; `Whoa, this is not the way to move on this!`
`0x43003e61`; `Ouch... that stung.`
`0x43003e62`; `Too close that one... as in it hit me.`
`0x43003e63`; `Ow... now that's personal.`
`0x43003e64`; `It got me! `
`0x43003e65`; `Whoa, now I'm mad.`
`0x43003e66`; `Yikes... that thing is good.`
`0x43003e67`; `I'm gonna have to be careful...`
`0x43003e68`; `Barely nicked me... this time.`
`0x43003e69`; `That thing actually hit me!`
`0x43003e6a`; `Whoa, that's not nice. Payback on its way.`
`0x43003e6b`; `Not feeling so good here.`
`0x43003e6c`; `Slowing down team!`
`0x43003e6d`; `Got to get some energy and fast!`
`0x43003e6e`; `Wind's out of my sails... and tail... and here!`
`0x43003e6f`; `Feeling a bit weak.`
`0x43003e70`; `Not going good here team... health a bit low!`
`0x43003e71`; `This mission's taken its toll.`
`0x43003e72`; `Whew, feeling a little wiped here.`
`0x43003e73`; `Got to get my mojo back. Some juicy pellets would be nice.`
`0x43003e74`; `Just an FYI! Not feeling A-Okay team.`
`0x43003e75`; `Things getting hotter here team!`
`0x43003e76`; `Now that really hurt!`
`0x43003e77`; `Don't worry - but taking some hits here.`
`0x43003e78`; `Ah - didn't see that one!`
`0x43003e79`; `That was just luck... bad luck!`
`0x43003e7a`; `Don't worry - still okay here. `
`0x43003e7b`; `Arrrr! Okay, team... I gotta stay focused here.`
`0x43003e7c`; `Still mobile here - gotta keep my eyes open.`
`0x43003e7d`; `Gotta turn this around here.`

`0x4300351f`; `Soon as we have communications back, we better check in with everyone. Maybe some—hey—what the heck? What are those things?`
`0x43003520`; `Warning! Security Breach detected. All non-essential personnel should evacuate immediately.`
`0x430035b3`; `Tell ya - that Saber sure has a ton of security working overtime tonight!`
`0x430035b4`; `Yeah - I hear he’s making some big Saberling announcement worldwide.`
`0x430035b5`; `Who cares! Long as we get paid!`
`0x430035b6`; `Darwin - you reading me?`
`0x430035b7`; `Okay, I'm in. But the guards look like they’re having a party out here. I'll proceed anyway - straight to the infil. You just stay in contact with me!`
`0x430035b8`; `Roger that. Plans indicate a drainage pipe on the far side of the garden area - confirm with a visual when you can.`
`0x430035ba`; `Darwin, you're gonna need to use the jetpack to boost over the railing. Aw man, I just wish I was the one doing this infil...`
`0x430035bd`; `What time is this gig supposed to end?`
`0x430035be`; `What're you worried about? This couldn’t be an easier job. Stop your belly-aching!`
`0x430035bf`; `Everything cool, Darwin? You inside the mansion?`
`0x430035c0`; `Safe inside. Blaster, Juarez, hit me with an update.`
`0x430035c1`; `En route to the target.`
`0x430035c2`; `I'm just where you want me – in position and preparing your exfil.`
`0x430035c3`; `Come in sectors 3 and 4. All secure for the countdown?`
`0x430035c4`; `All secure here.`
`0x430035c5`; `And here.`
`0x430035c6`; `Security - we’re in a green-light state for the countdown.`
`0x430035c7`; `Guess what - got us a surprise security camera here, guys, I'm going to need our fly on the wall to get around it!`
`0x430035c8`; `Affirmative. Help's on the way. Expect Mooch at your position any minute now. I've calibrated his beam to scramble the camera's video signal. That should give you just about enough time to sneak past unseen... that is if you hustle, amigo.`
`0x430035c9`; `Thanks, Juarez! `
`0x430035ce`; `Darwin, can you confirm you have Saber in sight?`
`0x430035cf`; `You bet I do, and he's wearing some mighty sharp threads... But I'm afraid the security checkpoint looks all locked down. `
`0x430035d1`; `Good. This is my big moment - a personal triumph! The world changes tonight.`
`0x430035d2`; `Yes, sir. Your SaberSense will literally... run the world!`
`0x430035d3`; `Has the backup power system been checked?`
`0x430035d4`; `When last checked, sir, it was at full strength. Shall I do another test?`
`0x430035d5`; `Of course you should! Do you have to ask?`
`0x430035d6`; `Er, no sir-just-I will do that now!`
`0x430035d7`; `Nothing must go wrong tonight.`
`0x430035d8`; `Darwin, are you clear to hack the computer and get into the control room?`
`0x430035d9`; `Got the target in sight. Ready to access the main computer - `
`0x430035da`; `I'm getting zero access here, talk to me! `
`0x430035db`; `Wait a second! Okay - you're going to need a keycard for access. I've checked all the camera feeds and the keycard for the terminal is sitting right on the conference table. You'll have to send Mooch in.`
`0x430035dc`; `We're on it! `
`0x430035df`; `Mooch - listen up ­- once you've got that keycard, you're gonna have to find another way out. You won’t get through those fans carrying that payload!`
`0x430035e0`; `Darwin, hate to rush you - but we don’t have much time before countdown.`
`0x430035e1`; `Reading you loud and clear.`
`0x430035e2`; `Exiting now, Juarez. Blaster, in position?`
`0x430035e3`; `All set, D.`
`0x430035e4`; `Excellent work as usual, Darwin. I'm reading zero communications from the conference room. Couldn't have gone smoother.`
`0x430035e5`; `We have all the recording systems online and no problems, Mr. Saber.`
`0x430035e6`; `Hang on. Those are not wedding bells. Not good... what just happened!?`
`0x430035e7`; `I don’t know Darwin, I’m picking up alarms everywhere! The whole mansion just went into maximum alert!`
`0x430035e8`; `Right - G-Force, everyone to the alternate rendezvous point - now!`
`0x430035e9`; `Bad just got worse...`
`0x430035ea`; `Whoa! Be careful Darwin, those things look crazy!`
`0x430035eb`; `Ben I need some quick intel - what in the world’s going on!`
`0x430035ec`; `I'm working on it and heading to your location right now. The SWAT team's already arrived so remember, G-Force is highly classified...`
`0x430035ed`; `Invisible, Invincible, right?`
`0x430037d2`; `If you had the jetpack we’d have to scrape you off the ceiling!`
`0x430038b4`; `Use Mooch for recon - he may be able to find a way through...`
`0x43003a0a`; `Don’t you wanna know how I'm doing, chica?`
`0x43003a0b`; `If I want, I’ll ask, comprendes...?`
`0x43003a12`; `And you’d love to do that!`
`0x43003a1a`; `Juarez - yes, I’ve got the pipe in sight. Heading in now!`
`0x43003a1b`; `Tracking you all the way in...`
`0x43003a2e`; `Okay got the keycard and in position. Hacking in now...`
`0x43003a59`; `I’m at the infil location but we may have an access problem here...`
`0x43003a5f`; `The door’s sealed, gonna need an alternative entry point.`
`0x43003a61`; `Got it.`
`0x43003b47`; `Saber sure has us on high alert tonight, huh?`
`0x43003b48`; `You can say that again. All this security, It’s gotta be something big.`
`0x43003b49`; `Yeah - whatever it is...`
`0x43003b4a`; `Yanshu - my wizard behind SaberSense and always so mysterious. Even today I don't get to see you? So secretive... and on this our day of triumph. Is everything in place?`
`0x43003b4b`; `Yes, Mr. Saber. All regions have checked in.`
`0x43003b4c`; `Satellite tracking locked in?`
`0x43003b4d`; `Oh yes, Mr. Saber - all locked and ready.`
`0x43003b4e`; `Good - the news teams are standing by for a remote live interview and I’ll be glad to talk to everyone - after the launch.`
`0x43003b4f`; `To SaberSense! And to my friends around the world... turning points in history are few and far between. This is a day of triumph, a day that will change the world... forever.`
`0x43003b50`; `Imagine a world where everything that helps us with common chores and tasks of daily life... can communicate with each other... and with us! You who are watching are indeed privileged to be able to witness the dawn of this new age, the age of SaberSense!`
`0x43003b51`; `Tonight, all around the world, everything changes with the launch of SaberSense in just minutes - and you will be able to watch it all from around the globe! `
`0x43003b52`; `It's not too much to say that this day will be recorded as the day life as we knew it changed forever.`
`0x43003b53`; `One last check-in with two key members on my on-site scientific team, Drs. Elaine and Elliot Stone.`
`0x43003b54`; `Is everything in order?`
`0x43003b55`; `The SaberSense satellite relays have all been activated, Mr. Saber, all in accordance with Yanshu’s instructions.`
`0x43003b56`; `And your factory’s chip production for the world-wide rollout is well ahead of Yanshu’s schedule. `
`0x43003b57`; `Fantastic. Then all is ready... When I press this simple button... the future arrives, and there can be no turning back.`
`0x43003b58`; `That's what he thinks, right Darwin?`
`0x43003b59`; `What the...? What just happened to the video link? This is impossible ... You...come with me now - and fast\n\n`
`0x43003b5a`; `Excellent work as usual, Darwin. I'm reading zero communications from the conference room. Couldn't have gone smoother.`
`0x43003b5d`; `Tonight, Leonard Saber will launch SaberSense worldwide, and with his private network of satellites, every Saberling appliance will immediately be linked and able to communicate with each other, and with their owners.`
`0x43003b5e`; `Okay, G-Force - you know what this SaberSense can really do. Agent Darwin, set the mission profile.`
`0x43003b5f`; `Affirmative, Ben. The FBI’s been tracking Leonard Saber’s top-secret work on SaberSense for years. But we know it has to be stopped, and it has to be stopped now. Questions? Okay-`
`0x43003b60`; `We make a full team insertion just outside the mansion. I’ll make a quick and clean infil at the garden... here. Once I reach the conference control room, Juarez, you will link with me to shut the system down and make sure SaberSense never launches. Blaster, you recce our possible exfils.`
`0x43003b61`; `FYI guys - Saber will have a lot of security. Remember your unit is covert. You do not exist. `
`0x43003b62`; `Invisible... invincible...`
`0x43003b63`; `We’re gonna bring that SaberSense down!`
`0x43003b64`; `Plan locked. Team ready? It’s... showtime!`
`0x43003b65`; `Hey... keep her steady, Blaster. `
`0x43003b66`; `Entry point locked. `
`0x43003b67`; `Team Break... now! `
`0x43003b68`; `Darwin, if you would be so kind.`
`0x43003b69`; `Oh yeah...`
`0x43003b6a`; `What the-? Elliot, your satellites are making the power supply spike all over the complex! You have to stop them now!`
`0x43003b6b`; `No, that can't be... let me check the backup systems.`
`0x43003b6c`; `This isn’t right at all. Come on!`
`0x43003b6d`; `Tommy, I told you it’s dinner time now, mister!`
`0x43003b6e`; `Okay, Mom! Mom, it's moving, my lamp's alive! It's flying!`
`0x43003b6f`; `And be sure to wash your hands before you come down.`
`0x43003b70`; `Help!`
`0x43003b71`; `Tonight’s launch of SaberSense by billionaire Leonard Saber will, Saber claims, forever change the way the whole world uses their appliances.`
`0x43003b72`; `Honey, did you take the garbage out yet? It's starting to smell.`
`0x43003b73`; `In a minute - I’m almost done here!`
`0x43003b74`; `What the...`
`0x43003b75`; `What did you just do?`
`0x43003b76`; `I didn’t do anything.`
`0x43003b77`; `The whole system's completely down.`
`0x43003c93`; `Use your scanner Darwin, let’s get some data to work with.`
`0x43003c94`; `Got one - a maintenance vent on the roof. I’ve updated your mission computer.`
`0x43003d3a`; `(coughing)`
`0x43003d3b`; `Now the phone’s dead!`
`0x43003d3c`; `What’s going on?`
`0x43003d3d`; `I... can’t... breathe!`
`0x43003d3e`; `Warning! Security Breach has been detected. All non-essential personnel should evacuate immediately...`
`0x43003d3f`; `Attention. This is an all systems alert. Repeat: an all systems alert.`
`0x43003d40`; `Attention: power surges have been detected throughout all areas. System override and shutdown has failed. Immediate evacuation is now recommended.`
`0x43003d6e`; `We have all the recording systems online and no problems, Mr. Saber.`
`0x43003fa6`; `Good riddance.`
`0x43003fa7`; `Ah, probably gone back to the kicthen - yuck!`
`0x43003fa8`; `The rat's gone…good thing!`
`0x43003fa9`; `Maybe it's one of them - I dunno - illusions.`
`0x43003faa`; `Ah, I give up. Thing's gone back to its rat home.`
`0x43003fab`; `Okay, mouse gone, back to my usual patrol.`
`0x43003fac`; `Sheeesh... thing just up and disappeared!`
`0x43003fad`; `Great--now the rodent can be someone else's problem.`
`0x43003fae`; `K... I looked, and it’s gone. Did my job!`
`0x43003faf`; `That thing moves pretty fast.`
`0x43003fc4`; `What the - that a rat!`
`0x43003fc5`; `Hey - some kind of mouse? `
`0x43003fc6`; `Can't they afford an exterminator here?`
`0x43003fc7`; `Great! Just what we need mice!`
`0x43003fc8`; `What - where did that furball come from?`
`0x43003fc9`; `Hey - uh, what is that thing?`
`0x43003fca`; `Gonna need some rodent traps!`
`0x43003fcb`; `Where'd that thing come from?`
`0x43003fcc`; `Huh - I'm gonna step on  that thing!`
`0x43003fcd`; `Is that a cat or somethin'?`
`0x43004038`; `What the...?`
`0x43004039`; `What just happened to the video link?`
`0x4300403a`; `This is impossible... You... come with me now - and fast!`
`0x43004072`; `I... can’t... breathe!\n\n`
`0x4300415f`; `To SaberSense! And to my friends around the world... turning points in history are few and far between.`
`0x43004160`; `This is a day of triumph, a day that will change the world... forever.`
`0x4300416b`; `Entry point locked. `
`0x43004328`; `Okay Mom!`
`0x43004329`; `Mom, it’s moving, my lamp’s alive! It’s flying!`
`0x4300353b`; `Buckle up, Darwin, this may get a little scary.`
`0x4300353c`; `Just in the nick of time.`
`0x4300353d`; `And just the way I like it. (a beat) Now I'm going to go real fast...so hold on!`
`0x4300353e`; `Those blasts are coming mighty close, Blaster.`
`0x4300353f`; `Don't worry D -- they can't touch us. Not with me driving!`
`0x430035ad`; `Listen --  I don't care what you have to do.....but find out what is going on now! What, huh?`
`0x430035ae`; `Yes, do whatever you have to do, then go--`
`0x430035ee`; `Darwin - where are you?`
`0x430035ef`; `Getting out now. Any sign of the SWAT team?`
`0x430035f0`; `Not yet. `
`0x430035f1`; `This is just plain weird, D!`
`0x430035f2`; `And a little deadly too...`
`0x430035f3`; `I wish Speckles was here!`
`0x430035f5`; `Whoa - the cavalry's definitely arrived.`
`0x430035f6`; `And picking up more SWAT all over the place!`
`0x430035f7`; `Guys, SaberSense is most definitely... activated! `
`0x430035f8`; `If that’s SaberSense, I’m staying away from appliances!`
`0x430035fb`; `Guess what? Saber’s down two cooks, and his waffle irons are after me.`
`0x430035fc`; `Hold the syrup - you have got to be kidding me!`
`0x43003602`; `Darwin? Hate to, like, rush you. But sounds like something really nasty's trying to get in!`
`0x43003603`; `Darwin - get a move on! That door isn't gonna hold up for long.`
`0x43003604`; `I hear you... but how can I stop that thing! If I open the elevator door Blaster’s a goner. How about a plan B!`
`0x43003605`; `Strange... there’s some kind of liquid on the floor.`
`0x43003606`; `Okay - Speckles. Got a nice view of the heating hub. I should be able to make my way there.`
`0x43003608`; `Alright, I see the central heating hub; but I don’t think it's a good idea to head in there... unless I want to get barbecued.`
`0x43003609`; `According to these building schematics, the center of the hub has the heating ducts for the whole complex. Following the correct one should... lead you right to the main Saberling offices. It's your only shot, Darwin.`
`0x4300360a`; `Hmm okay Specks - Juarez, the room's locked down. Any suggestions?`
`0x4300360b`; `Wish I could help... there's nothing I can do from this end. You'll need to find the shut-off valves. Check around the hub... there should be four of them.`
`0x4300360c`; `Warning! Heating system pressure has attained critical level. All heating valves require manual shut down immediately.`
`0x4300360d`; `Great- pressure’s dropping already. Only three more valves to go!`
`0x4300360e`; `Shutdown complete. Heating system now returning to normal.`
`0x4300360f`; `Good work, Darwin. Now you should be able to access the central computer area from there.`
`0x43003610`; `Are you sure?`
`0x43003611`; `Trust me - I know everything about this building. `
`0x43003615`; `Okay Juarez, Blaster - I’m in the Saberling Office reception area.`
`0x43003616`; `What’s your plan, Darwin?`
`0x43003617`; `I’ll have Mooch disable the lasers. Then I should be able to get in.`
`0x43003618`; `You go for it, Darwin!`
`0x4300361a`; `Darwin, I think there might be a shortcut through the Accounting offices, I can open the door for you...`
`0x4300361b`; `Roger that, Specks.`
`0x4300361e`; `Darwin? Report, are you ok?`
`0x4300361f`; `Things got a little hot, but I'm still in one piece.`
`0x43003620`; `...Sorry - those irons didn't show up on my scan. I'm going to have to recalibrate my equipment.`
`0x43003621`; `I’m okay. I’ll find another way around.`
`0x43003626`; `Okay, you’re still far from the computer room but you have a clear run to it from your current position. Blaster, can you for once hustle?`
`0x4300362e`; `Good news Darwin, I've located the speaker blueprints. They’re somewhere on this floor, I’ll be able to pinpoint the signal when you are closer.`
`0x4300362f`; `Thanks Juarez! `
`0x43003632`; `Darwin - Ben here. You have the Saberlizer?`
`0x43003633`; `Is that what this thing is?`
`0x43003634`; `Yeah, that's what I'm calling it. Okay, you can shoot it at any Saberling appliance and it should trigger the weaponization sequence. If you're careful you can then use the appliances to your advantage.`
`0x43003639`; `Okay Darwin - scans show that the blueprints are somewhere in that room. When you find them I can recalibrate your headset so the sonic waves don't touch you.`
`0x4300363a`; `If they’re here - I’ll find them.`
`0x4300363b`; `Juarez, I have the blueprints.`
`0x4300363c`; `Scanning now. Okay - just a sec... alright - your headset has been calibrated. You’re good to go!`
`0x4300363d`; `Great - back in the game. Thanks Juarez. I'm heading back to the computer center.`
`0x4300363e`; `Juarez, just a double-check before I re-enter the disco - can you confirm that my suit is ready?`
`0x4300363f`; `All recalibrated. No worries - you’re fully protected from the speakers’ sonic charge.`
`0x43003640`; `Great!`
`0x43003641`; `Hold on Juarez... I got a SWAT team down!`
`0x43003642`; `Checking their vitals. OK - pulse and respiration all normal. The speakers just rendered them unconscious.`
`0x43003643`; `Okay then, so there's no way I can get to the computer center... unless I mute that bad music!`
`0x43003644`; `Darwin - I've plotted a secure path for you directly to the computer core. Proceed straight ahead, then take the elevator to make your final infil right into the core center.`
`0x43003645`; `Closing in... good work.`
`0x43003646`; `Okay, I’m in the elevator. Sit-rep, team?`
`0x43003647`; `Situation’s all quiet here, Darwin.`
`0x43003648`; `Ready as ever for your exfil, D.`
`0x4300364a`; `Thanks, Speckles.`
`0x4300364d`; `Okay, I’m at the computer core control room. But the security door is sealed tight. Think you can crack it remotely, Speckles?`
`0x4300364e`; `Yes, of course I can. But we have a small problem. Saber has the codes stored on two secure servers, both heavily protected. No way I can access them from the network. Darwin. I'm afraid you're going to have to plant WiFi transmitters on each server to give me access.`
`0x4300364f`; `Copy that, Specks! `
`0x43003650`; `Speckles - can you give me a signal check? `
`0x43003651`; `Yes, receiving it loud and clear; only one more to go, Darwin.`
`0x43003652`; `Okay - both transmitters planted. You should be all set, Chief.`
`0x43003653`; `Confirming that. Now make your way back to the Security Door and just leave the rest to me.`
`0x4300382b`; `Darwin - those doors are locked. And my scans show no other way forward.`
`0x4300382c`; `Woah! I’m getting massive energy readings from that laser Darwin. It might be strong enough to destroy the doors... `
`0x4300382d`; `OK Darwin, you’ll need to follow those pipes through those vents. That should lead you to a way out of this place.`
`0x4300382e`; `Got to tell ya - looks real dark down there. But those pipes... they're heated, right? In infrared, they’ll glow like Christmas lights.`
`0x430038b2`; `There’s lots of stuff here but no way forward. What’s going on? I’m going to have to go back to the reception area and see if there is another way - Speckles, check your schematics again. I don’t want to be running around in circles.`
`0x430038b5`; `They’re emitting ultra high frequency waves. I’m going to search for the speaker blueprints so you can neutralize them...`
`0x430038b6`; `OK, my scans show that the blueprints are stored in the design wing of the complex. I’m updating your mission computer now...`
`0x430038b7`; `I always hustle! I’m almost there, D!`
`0x430038b8`; `Music to my ears...`
`0x430038bb`; `That's way too high, I'll never make it over...`
`0x430038bc`; `Hmm... that extractor fan's suction might just provide enough force. Jump into the stream, it should lift you high enough to make it over.`
`0x430038bd`; `Good thinking!`
`0x430038be`; `Getting into the hub might be tricky, but the jetpack could be of use here...`
`0x430038c6`; `Darwin - only one more valve left!`
`0x430038d6`; `Okay Darwin-just hack in, and I will upload the virus!`
`0x430038d7`; `Roger Speckles.`
`0x430038d8`; `This is it, Darwin. Bring ‘er down!`
`0x430038d9`; `Wait a second! The system shows that it's still online. The virus didn’t work? `
`0x430038da`; `Aborting the mission! G-Force— everyone ex-fil!`
`0x430038db`; `Getting out --now!`
`0x430038dc`; `Moving now Darwin! `
`0x430038dd`; `Hurley, Hurley – come in  Hurley?`
`0x430038de`; `Okay, okay -- I was looking for something to eat. `
`0x430038df`; `Hurley—get out of there! `
`0x430038e0`; `Jeeze-I’m leaving already!`
`0x430038e1`; `Guys I ….need some help…like now! `
`0x430038e2`; `Somebody, anybody…`
`0x430038e3`; `I am so done for...I’ve had my last lunchtime`
`0x430038e4`; `Hey!`
`0x430038e5`; `You should lose some weight, Porky.`
`0x430038e6`; `Yee-haw—Piece of cake.`
`0x430038e7`; `Let’s get out of here.`
`0x430038ea`; `Wait... if you open the door for the SWAT team then they’ll take that shredder out, right?`
`0x430038eb`; `Great plan B, Ms J! `
`0x430038ec`; `Okay, I’m all clear here. Moving on to plant the transmitters now.`
`0x430038ed`; `Darwin, sorry I didn’t pick up those appliances before they got to you.`
`0x430038ee`; `That's okay Specs - We'll be done soon and out of here!`
`0x430038ef`; `Darwin, this door’s about to pop! `
`0x430038f0`; `Just hang in there fur ball! Darwin’s on his way!`
`0x430039dc`; `Hey Darwin, now that you’re done playing with those things, how about getting me outta here! `
`0x43003a63`; `Yeah... OK, so I’m gonna look around for something I can Saberlize...`
`0x43003a64`; `Good idea...`
`0x43003a70`; `Darwin - nice work with the Saberlizer.`
`0x43003a71`; `My scans aren’t showing any appliances there at all. I’ll keep monitoring you all the way to the core.`
`0x43003a72`; `Hey - do you guys ever break for lunch?`
`0x43003a73`; `Hurley? Cut the chatter. Stand by for my infil into the Computer Core.`
`0x43003a89`; `Juarez, can you analyze what's going on with this door.`
`0x43003a8a`; `Checking... It’s not a normal door. The blueprints of the building show that it is some kind of Saberling device.`
`0x43003a8b`; `Darwin, I’m reading a Sabersense signal from the security door, why don’t you try the Saberlizer on it?`
`0x43003af2`; `You never were much in the kitchen.`
`0x43003af3`; `The game’s just changed. Focus guys!`
`0x43003af4`; `Right D - I’m getting the RDV now! Let’s boogie out of here!`
`0x43003af5`; `Juarez - please tell me the rest of the mansion’s quiet?`
`0x43003af6`; `Sorry D - the place is alive with signals.`
`0x43003af7`; `Great... Okay, everyone keep heading to the rendezvous. Blaster - how you doing?`
`0x43003af8`; `I’m in the elevator making my way to the RDV.`
`0x43003af9`; `Unit Three here... all clear in this sector.`
`0x43003afa`; `Roger that-we’ll continue our sweep of the area-over.`
`0x43003afb`; `All teams, stay close and everyone look alive now.`
`0x43003afe`; `Darwin, those speakers can do you some serious harm, you’ll need to get those blueprints before you can get past them.`
`0x43003aff`; `I’m doing my best guys!`
`0x43003b00`; `You’re doing great, Juarez. We all miss Specks - but we’ll manage... I'm almost out team.`
`0x43003b1b`; `Right... the schematics must have an error. I’ll double check. `
`0x43003b1c`; `Darwin - those barriers are closing in fast. Find a way out... now! `
`0x43003b27`; `Darwin, the torch is protected by shields, you’ll have to eliminate the satellites before you take it down. `
`0x43003b28`; `The torch missiles are designed to penetrate shields; try attracting its missiles towards the satellite barrier.`
`0x43003b29`; `Darwin, your weapons are no use.  You must attract one of the torch missiles to hit the satellite dish shield.  Only once all the satellite dishes are destroyed will the torch be vulnerable.`
`0x43003b2a`; `The barrier is down Darwin; time to take out that Torch!`
`0x43003b7b`; `Alright, move, move, move! Spread out through the house and look alive!`
`0x43003b7c`; `Huh?! What?`
`0x43003b7d`; `All units... we’re being attacked by a hostile... fan!`
`0x43003b7e`; `Unit 5 reporting... we’ve got hostile contact with... Saberling appliances.`
`0x43003b7f`; `Help! It’s after me!`
`0x43003b80`; `Contact!`
`0x43003b81`; `Okay - all units... Area clear! Be alert!`
`0x43003b82`; `I tell you, we throw away more food than Mr. Saber and his fancy friends eat.`
`0x43003b83`; `And all these appliances. The food practically cooks itself.`
`0x43003b84`; `Don't say that or we’ll be out of a job!`
`0x43003b85`; `Guys, hate to bother you. But I got a problem here. The elevator’s stopped cold, the door’s jammed and - I’m inside! You best go on without me.`
`0x43003b86`; `Command, we just took out... a paper shredder. Yeah - you heard me right - a shredder!`
`0x43003b88`; `Guys, I think my elevator ride is... over!`
`0x43003b89`; `Whoa, that was too close! Thanks for the rescue, Darwin. I owe you big time!`
`0x43003b8a`; `Forget it. You’d do the same for me.`
`0x43003b8b`; `Darwin - do I ever have a surprise for you.`
`0x43003b8c`; `Greetings, Darwin.`
`0x43003b8d`; `Speckles? What? I thought you were... what happened, old friend?`
`0x43003b8e`; `I adapted your plan for escape, Darwin, and managed with great difficulty to get out of that trash compactor in the, um, nick of time. But that’s a story for next time.`
`0x43003b8f`; `Understood Specks - great to have you back!`
`0x43003b90`; `As they say that is the good news; the bad is all of Saber's appliances have somehow become activated - each and every one. The place is alive with them.`
`0x43003b91`; `Any ideas?`
`0x43003b92`; `Yes - you have to get into the Central Computer and shut it down. And the best option is to head down to the basement by the laundry chute, and get past the heating hub. I’ll plot a course to guide you from there.`
`0x43003b93`; `Darwin - listen up! Ben says he has something that can help us. I’ll go rendezvous with him now!`
`0x43003b94`; `Not on my watch. Juarez, tell me how I can free Blaster! `
`0x43003b95`; `My scan shows that you can reach the control room at the end of the route you’re on. You should be able to free Blaster from there.`
`0x43003b96`; `Unit 5, status report? Unit 5, check in now! Unit 5 - what’s your situation!... Is anyone there?`
`0x43003b97`; `sit-rep team?`
`0x43003b98`; `All set here to monitor your progress to the computer, Darwin.`
`0x43003b99`; `Listen up, D-I got some hot new gear from Ben and I’ll be with you in a New York minute!`
`0x43003b9a`; `Just don’t drop it.`
`0x43003b9b`; `And Darwin, keep us updated on your progress.`
`0x43003b9c`; `I’m eating now and, um, it’s going well. `
`0x43003b9d`; `Hurley - spare us, okay? `
`0x43003b9e`; `Surprise Mr D! Told you I’d be here. And look what I got for you!`
`0x43003b9f`; `It injects a SaberSense chip into an appliance. Turns them into crazy weapons!`
`0x43003ba0`; `And that’s good?`
`0x43003ba1`; `I'm sure you can figure it out, D!`
`0x43003ba2`; `Thanks - I guess...`
`0x43003ba3`; `Good luck with it, Darwin.`
`0x43003ba4`; `Darwin, I've just arrived on site. Where’s Blaster?`
`0x43003ba5`; `He’s on his way to rendezvous with you.`
`0x43003ba6`; `Yes, I was wondering if you could help me... yes... Where’s my taxi!`
`0x43003ba7`; `Five minutes is not good enough! Well let me tell you something Samantha, we have a big account with you... Like I care. Well fix it!`
`0x43003ba8`; `What the...? You have got to be kidding me...`
`0x43003ba9`; `Oh my... get 'em away from me... you... you... get 'em away... oh my... close the door... come on... come on!`
`0x43003baa`; `Okay, Speckles. I’m at the access door.`
`0x43003bab`; `Hang on... there. It should be open.`
`0x43003bac`; `You are a genius. Heading in!`
`0x43003bad`; `Okay Darwin - just hack in, and I will upload the virus!`
`0x43003bae`; `Roger Specks.`
`0x43003baf`; `This is it, Darwin. Bring ‘er down!`
`0x43003bb0`; `Wait a second! The system shows that it's still online. The virus didn’t work?`
`0x43003bb1`; `Aborting the mission! G-Force - everyone ex-fil!`
`0x43003bb2`; `Getting out - now!`
`0x43003bb3`; `Moving now Darwin!`
`0x43003bb4`; `Hurley, Hurley - come in Hurley?`
`0x43003bb5`; `Okay, okay - I was looking for something to eat. `
`0x43003bb6`; `Hurley - get out of there! `
`0x43003bb7`; `Okay, I'm leaving already!`
`0x43003bb8`; `Guys I... need some help... like now! `
`0x43003bb9`; `Somebody, anybody...`
`0x43003bba`; `I'm so done for...`
`0x43003bbb`; `Hey!`
`0x43003bbc`; `You should lose some weight, Porky.\n`
`0x43003bbd`; `Oh yeah! Piece of cake.`
`0x43003bbe`; `Let’s get out of here.`
`0x43003c95`; `Roger that—we’ll continue our sweep of the area—over.`
`0x43003c96`; `Blaster, you’ve been through there?`
`0x43003c97`; `Not my bad!`
`0x43003cad`; `Heating System Warning Lights: Heating hub is currently inaccessible due to dangerously high pressure.`

`0x43003cbb`; `You have got to be kidding me.`
`0x43003d52`; `Rescue Blaster!`
`0x43003d6f`; `The Saberlizer is a prototype, and its effects on different appliances are unpredictable. So take care.`
`0x43003d70`; `Great - I love surprises.`
`0x43003d71`; `You know... I think it’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship...`
`0x43003d72`; `Good work, Darwin.`
`0x43003d73`; `Good to have you back, ole’ mole!`
`0x43003d74`; `And good... to be back. `
`0x43003d75`; `Okay. Now - I’m off to the Central Computer...`
`0x43003db0`; `You have got to be kidding me`
`0x43003db6`; `I’m getting a reading change for the room you’re in. Be careful Darwin.`
`0x43003fcf`; `Heating Pressure: CRITICAL`

`0x4300405f`; `Okay D - it looks like the blueprints are locked up in a safe somewhere on that floor. Keep your eyes open...`
`0x43004060`; `Hey D! There’s the safe. You gotta find a way to bust it open!`
`0x4300407a`; `(Improvised vocal reactions to the attacking waffle maker as both characters run through the door to escape)`

`0x4300356b`; `(talking over each other); Almost there.`
`0x4300356c`; `Just there, Darwin,`
`0x4300356d`; `Keep movin’, Darwin!`
`0x4300356e`; `Time to get this thing racing. Hang on.`
`0x4300356f`; `Do  I get to do that?`
`0x430035af`; `Everyone almost at the rendezvous point, team?`
`0x430035b0`; `Ready to rendezvous -- and rock n roll.`
`0x43003664`; `Okay, I made it inside the factory - where Saber makes his deadly toys and ships them in nice boxes worldwide.`
`0x43003666`; `Speckles, what’s my target?`
`0x43003667`; `Darwin - that’s a power core generator. The core generator powers devices all around the complex. You can attract and pull out the core using your Electro-Whip.`
`0x43003668`; `That’s another power core generator Darwin. If you pull the core out, you can use it to power up the socket on the conveyor.`
`0x4300366a`; `That’s a power core socket, Darwin. The sockets power devices all around the complex... but you’ll need to throw a power core inside to activate it.`
`0x4300366b`; `Go ahead, Darwin - now throw the power core right into the socket.`
`0x4300366e`; `Speckles, I'm in a jam here. No exit from this storage area. Any ideas?`
`0x4300366f`; `Yes... I can see a vent leading from one of the storage rooms. Use Mooch for a quick recon and locate the exit.`
`0x43003670`; `Mooch my man - stand by for your flying orders...`
`0x43003671`; `Okay, Speckles I’ve arrived at the main storage depot.`
`0x43003672`; `Good, the security feeds show offices just ahead. I can also see that the elevator is not working. Go see if you can get it up and running again.`
`0x43003673`; `Thanks for the heads-up, Speckles.`
`0x43003681`; `I’m on my way!`
`0x43003685`; `Okay, Darwin. Now that you have access to the production plant, you have to get into the machinery room and shut down the production machinery.`
`0x43003686`; `Copy that!`
`0x4300368f`; `Speckles, that might be risky - you’ll have to go back to the Core. That area is crawling with those appliances.`
`0x43003691`; `Juarez, can you confirm my target?`
`0x43003692`; `The entrance to the machinery room is dead ahead, Darwin. Leads right to the production facility. Get in there, and you should be good.`
`0x43003699`; `Hurley, I can see your position. Not too pretty! I'm on my way.`
`0x4300369a`; `Thanks Darwin!`
`0x4300369b`; `And Hurley? Don’t do anything... I mean anything! Just stay put...`
`0x4300369c`; `Hurley, the door’s locked. Juarez, gonna need another way in - and fast...`
`0x4300369d`; `I hear you. Scanning for an alternate point of ingress. Not sure I see anything...`
`0x4300369e`; `Hang in there, Hurley. If there's a way in, Darwin will find it!`
`0x4300369f`; `Wait I’m seeing a control room on the upper floor. You just might be able to open the door from there.`
`0x430036ab`; `OK Darwin, equip the Magnetic Grapple, it’s time for a field test.`
`0x430036ac`; `Aim the grapple right at that weaponized speaker unit you see up there on the ceiling. Just hold the fire button and you will be pulled toward the speaker.`
`0x430036ad`; `Excellent! Now you’re attached to the speaker you can switch freely to use your other weapons.`
`0x430036ae`; `You should be able to charge the jetpack while hanging from a speaker to reach new areas. Give it a try.`
`0x430036af`; `Thanks Juarez - those speakers are all over this place... gonna be really handy...`
`0x430036b2`; `Darwin, I’m getting some strange readings from your location. Energy fluctuations all over the place.`
`0x430036b3`; `A problem?`
`0x430036b4`; `I don’t know. But remember you have to power up the machinery to continue on the conveyor. And be careful.`
`0x430036b5`; `Yeah, careful D - cause you know Juarez really wants to see you again.`
`0x430036b6`; `Can it, Blaster!`
`0x430036b7`; `Okay Darwin, just checked and you have a tricky patch up ahead. You’ll have to activate all three power sockets to make the system overload.`
`0x430036b8`; `Got it.`
`0x430036bb`; `Great work, Darwin! You’ve overloaded the main constructor device... but now comes the hard part. You have to get to the chip production line and bring it down.`
`0x430036bc`; `Best way there?`
`0x430036bd`; `There's a cargo platform in the room opposite. That will bring you directly to chip production. But you need to work fast!`
`0x430036be`; `Speckles, what’s happening at the core?`
`0x430036bf`; `Still working on the virus... Saber has made some tricky modifications to the software. But I think I can crack it. Where are you now?`
`0x430036c0`; `Near the cargo platform, and ready to bring down the chip development area.`
`0x430036c1`; `Be careful Darwin-my scans aren’t showing me what you’ll find there.`
`0x430036c2`; `Stay tuned - I’ll let you know.`
`0x430036c3`; `You getting all this, Juarez?`
`0x430036c4`; `Darwin, that looks really dangerous. Be careful.`
`0x430036c5`; `Who knew washing machines were so complicated!`
`0x430036c6`; `I got a bad feeling about this. You sure there’s no way out of here?`
`0x430036c7`; `I’m looking...`
`0x430036c8`; `That was too close!`
`0x430036c9`; `The sky isn't falling but chunks of metal are!`
`0x430036ca`; `Oh great - somehow the appliances have found a way in here.`
`0x430036cb`; `Juarez, any clue what’s being manufactured around me?`
`0x430036cc`; `I’m checking on that...`
`0x430036cd`; `I think I'm... in the middle of a washing machine!`
`0x430036ce`; `This would be interesting if it wasn’t a trap!`
`0x430036cf`; `I'm running out of room here.`
`0x430036d0`; `Yes, it’s definitely a washing machine.`
`0x430036d1`; `Just don’t be inside when it gets turned on, D!`
`0x430036d2`; `I... think it’s done. And I’m okay!`
`0x430036d3`; `Great to hear, Darwin!`
`0x430036d4`; `And look at the plus side - now you know how they put washing machines together!`
`0x430036d5`; `Sit-rep guys. Blaster, any info on Saber?`
`0x430036d6`; `Still tracking him... but... we got some more company! The FBI is in the house!`
`0x430036d7`; `Stay out of their way, Blaster. Remember we’re working under deep cover here.`
`0x430036d8`; `You got it!`
`0x430036d9`; `Okay, Juarez - I’m at the chip production area. What do your scans show?`
`0x430036da`; `There are three phases in the chip production process, Darwin. You’ll have to shut them down in order, before you head onto the power generator.`
`0x430036db`; `Then that’s exactly what I’ll do sweet stuff. Heading to the first phase now...`
`0x430036dc`; `Darwin. Schematics show the next airlock close by. I’m working on locating it right now but first you need to shut down the first phase of production.`
`0x430036dd`; `I got a lock on Saber, Darwin. Won’t be long!`
`0x430036de`; `Great. And Juarez, you’re...`
`0x430036df`; `...Hold on... I think I'm about to experience a really close shave!`
`0x430036e0`; `Darwin, the scans here indicate that the robotic arms are made from some kind of strengthened alloy. You’ll have to use the Electro-Whip power attack to destroy them. That should shut down phase 1 of production.`
`0x430036e5`; `Great work Darwin - I’m showing you have the second phase of chip production stopped. Only one more to go.`
`0x430036e6`; `Okay - stay with me!`
`0x430036f5`; `Down to your last objective there, Darwin.`
`0x430036f6`; `Yeah, D... it’s showtime!`
`0x430036f7`; `The laser cutters are shielded by dampening equipment. You’ll have to deactivate them first. Once done you’ll need to use a high power beam to destroy them. Your Saberlizer will probably come in handy!`
`0x430036f8`; `It’s my new best friend...`
`0x430036f9`; `Darwin, just remember - you need to bring down the whole chip production operation before you leave.`
`0x430036fa`; `Chip production all destroyed. Gonna be impossible for Saber to put this mess back together..`
`0x430036fb`; `Next, you have to destroy the main generator. I'm still getting data on the layout there.`
`0x430036fc`; `Good - I’ll go there and get into position. Blaster, any news on Saber?`
`0x430036fd`; `Been tracking his signals. And I think I’m getting close.`
`0x430036fe`; `Close the deal, Blaster.`
`0x430036ff`; `Hey guys the machinery here is deactivated... got any quick ideas how I can get it working manually?`
`0x43003700`; `Come on D - this is old-school. You remember our cardio training, all those hours in the wheel? You just gotta start using your legs!`
`0x43003708`; `Okay team. I’ve activated that first turbine... moving onto number two, now.`
`0x43003709`; `Got a bit of problem here - the power core’s gone AWOL!`
`0x4300370a`; `You gotta fix that before the second turbine is good to go.`
`0x4300370b`; `Got it.`
`0x4300370c`; `Okay - good news - second turbine’s activated, and things are heating up!`
`0x4300370d`; `Darwin - we better plan your safe exfil before you start the last turbine.`
`0x4300370e`; `It’s going to get crazy hot in there, D. Me and Juarez got an idea. Though mostly it’s mine.`
`0x4300370f`; `Okay - I’m all ears.`
`0x43003710`; `When that system overheats it will trigger an emergency evac hatch to open. Once it does -`
`0x43003711`; `You jump out - and down, Darwin. Gonna be a big drop! Sounds like a blast!`
`0x43003712`; `And sounds like my only option.`
`0x43003715`; `All three turbines up and running, and the temp is shooting through the roof.`
`0x43003716`; `Right - and the emergency cooling system has kicked in Darwin;`
`0x43003717`; `Okay - the cooling system’s iced. Pretty sight. Wish you were here.`
`0x43003718`; `Attention... Power overload is imminent. Repeat. Power overload is imminent. Please evacuate this area immediately.`
`0x4300371b`; `Thanks for the warning…racing now!`
`0x4300371c`; `Darwin, I found Saber. He was just here... but he’s on the move again. Looks like we are not the only team getting close.`
`0x4300371d`; `The FBI? I’ll see if I can get video feed! Nice work, Furball!`
`0x4300371e`; `Darwin, remember you need to get the power core into the socket first.`
`0x430037da`; `Lock onto the socket by holding L2 and then press R2 to throw the core into it.`
`0x430038b9`; `Darwin - I’m getting extremely high radiation readings from that liquid.`
`0x430038ba`; `Confirmed. I’ll keep my paws out of it... don’t worry.`
`0x430038c9`; `You got to hurry, Darwin! Get back to the main assembly hub.`
`0x430038ca`; `I know. Any word from Speckles?`
`0x430038ce`; `Darwin, to get into the complex, make your way to the Main Assembly area. That conveyor should take you there, but you need to find some way of turning it on.`
`0x430038cf`; `Nice going D - those were some sweet moves!`
`0x430038d0`; `I've got a lock on Hurley's position. You need to use the Cargo Tram, it'll take you to him.`
`0x430038d1`; `You did it Darwin - you are amazing! The door's open!`
`0x430038f2`; `Darwin! I had the monorail schematics open and then... they just disappeared!`
`0x430038f3`; `Who... what just happened? I had the building layout on my headset... and it vanished! What’s going on?`
`0x430038f4`; `Darwin... this is very weird. I'm at the Computer Core. But it looks like... all the files have just been erased!`
`0x430038f5`; `Got to be Saber! The maniac’s anticipating every single move we make! And now he just wiped the plans off the core’s hard drive? Speckles, Juarez... keep looking for backup files.`
`0x430038f6`; `Will do.`
`0x430038f7`; `Of course I will, Darwin`
`0x430038f8`; `Juarez I've hacked into the first monorail. This baby’s going nowhere.`
`0x430038f9`; `Great - head to the second station. I'm still working on your route out.`
`0x430038fa`; `Got the elevator powered up.`
`0x430038fc`; `I’m approaching the third turbine now. Looks like it needs powering up too .`
`0x430038fd`; `Check around that level Darwin - there should be a Power Core generator nearby.`
`0x430039d5`; `Okay Darwin, I’m afraid you won’t be able to get through that door until the machinery below it is completely stopped. The only way to access the power core controlling it is through the air venting system... so guess it’s a job for Mooch.`

`0x43003b02`; `Good work Darwin, get to the activation lever and power up the second turbine.`
`0x43003b03`; `I have the final Power Core in place.`
`0x43003b04`; `Its going to get hot in there Darwin. Give that lever a pull.`
`0x43003bc2`; `Alright, Juarez. I’m at the production computer and you should be getting the factory plans now!`
`0x43003bc3`; `Coming though fine! Just stand by for another minute.`
`0x43003bc4`; `Looking at this... I see a plan. Best deal with the immediate threat first. Stop the shipping of the appliances... then their production. And after that... make sure that no more microchips get made.`
`0x43003bc5`; `Sounds good, Darwin.`
`0x43003bc6`; `Juarez, the button to stop the monorail is smashed. Can you find me another way?`
`0x43003bc7`; `Hold on... got one! You’ve got to get to the monorails themselves. Opening the access doors now.`
`0x43003bc8`; `You’re a star... making my way there now!`
`0x43003bcb`; `Nice... Okay, Juarez - both monorails shut down. No more shipments getting out of this plant. Tell me - have you gained access to the production facility?\n`
`0x43003bcc`; `Almost got it!`
`0x43003bcd`; `Good - gonna need that soon! Blaster, sit-rep amigo?`
`0x43003bce`; `I think I have a line on Saber, the man himself. Won’t be long, Darwin. He’s close!`
`0x43003bcf`; `Good work guys, Keep me updated! Speckles - you at the core yet?`
`0x43003bd0`; `Almost there, Darwin. And this time I think I can get the virus to work.`
`0x43003bd1`; `Darwin, I got it. I’m showing clear access to the production facility. I should be able to guide you straight through. But you better get moving - there may be heavy security backup.`
`0x43003bd9`; `Sorry-had a bit of distraction there.`
`0x43003bda`; `Found something interesting - the plans show a R&D lab in the east wing. Looks like they were working on some kind of magnetic grapple...`
`0x43003bdb`; `I could use that but I need you to hold position. Hurley - you’re going to have to get it for me.`
`0x43003bdc`; `Really? Me? My first G-Force mission!`
`0x43003bdd`; `Juarez, download the schematics to him... now get moving Hurley!`
`0x43003bde`; `And Darwin - I just hacked in and opened the door to the monorail control room!`
`0x43003bdf`; `Great work, Juarez!`
`0x43003be0`; `Er, Darwin... I found the grapple!`
`0x43003be1`; `Hey, not bad Hurley, not... bad. Now bring it right to me asap.`
`0x43003be2`; `Thanks Darwin... But I got, um, update. I’m having a bit of a problem here... Actually, I think it’s more than a bit... Help!!!`
`0x43003be3`; `Hurley... don’t move! I’ll get your position and get to you as fast as I can.`
`0x43003be4`; `Faster would be better! Not that I mean to rush you.`
`0x43003be5`; `Just hang in there, Hurley.`
`0x43003be6`; `Boy, am I glad to see you.`
`0x43003be7`; `Glad you’re okay too.`
`0x43003be8`; `Here you go...`
`0x43003be9`; `Now - get back to Juarez and fast. Unless you want to play some more with the waffle irons...`
`0x43003bea`; `Say no more amigo!`
`0x43003bf0`; `Now that was close. I almost became a part of the rinse cycle!`
`0x43003bf1`; `Glad you’re okay. You had us worried there.`
`0x43003bf2`; `I want to go on that ride, D! That had to be fun!`
`0x43003bf3`; ` You can do it next time, Blaster!`
`0x43003bf4`; `Good you made it through okay, Darwin. Where do you go now?`
`0x43003bf5`; `Now... on to the microchip production.`
`0x43003bf9`; `Juarez could you-`
`0x43003bfa`; `You read my mind. Thanks!`
`0x43003bfb`; `I just hope that door holds up!`
`0x43003bfc`; `That’s one angry shredder - but the reinforced glass is holding. Got some scientists inside and they’re cornered. Can you patch me into them?`
`0x43003bfd`; `Hold on... okay, they should hear you over the speaker.`
`0x43003bfe`; `Um, hello. This is Special Security Agent, er, Darwin. You okay in there?`
`0x43003bff`; `For now, yes. But we’re trapped!`
`0x43003c00`; `Thanks to your bright idea. You thought all this was a problem with my chips. We know different now don’t we...`
`0x43003c01`; `Okay... don't worry. I’ll get to a position where I can help. You two just hang tight.`
`0x43003c03`; `Er, hi. You okay in there?`
`0x43003c04`; `Agent Darwin? No, decidedly not ok, you could say "out of the frying pan into the fire"...`
`0x43003c05`; `They’re worse than pitbulls. Of course, he likes pitbulls!`
`0x43003c06`; `Um right - I hear you. I’m part of a team working on that. But can you tell me another way around this area? I can’t get through the airlock.`
`0x43003c07`; `Hmmm... No, there isn’t one - that airlock is the only way.`
`0x43003c08`; `Yeah... unless you re-route the pneumatic tubing to get past the airlock... but you'd have to be the size of a guinea pig to fit in that tube! Good luck with that!`
`0x43003c09`; `Um thanks...`
`0x43003c0b`; `Yes. Stay right there for now. I'll be sure to let... the SWAT team know that you're here.`
`0x43003c0c`; `Did you just-`
`0x43003c0d`; `What the...?`
`0x43003c0e`; `Um, I didn’t see it... if you didn’t!`
`0x43003c0f`; `Okay Juarez - got another problem here. I can’t access the third airlock. Any alternates?`
`0x43003c10`; `I can’t see another way. I think you best get to the security room and look for an alternate once you’re there.`
`0x43003c18`; `Everyone almost at the rendezvous point?`
`0x43003c19`; `Already there!`
`0x43003c1c`; `Blaster, time to get this thing racing. `
`0x43003c98`; `Should we - we stay here until someone stops these shredders?`
`0x43003ca1`; `Double time it, Darwin. The overload is happening faster than I calculated!`
`0x43003ca2`; `Moving out now!`
`0x43003ca6`; `Good. Heading back to the main chamber to take it out.`
`0x43003cbc`; `Alright, the first part of the chip production process has been totally trashed. Not bad...`
`0x43003cbd`; `Great-I have that second airlock open and all ready for you. Now onto the second production phase.`
`0x43003cbe`; `On my way now!`
`0x43003cbf`; `Okay... entering the primary generator sector now. How do we shut this monster down for good?`
`0x43003cc0`; `Here’s an idea. If you overload the generator you’ll send it into a meltdown state; that should do the trick.`
`0x43003cc1`; `Check me on this... the plans show three turbines feeding into the generator, right? So... If I get all of them running at once, the whole place will get mighty ‘hot’ and fast!`
`0x43003cc2`; `I’m not sure about that, Darwin. Could be too dangerous... you might not have enough time to get out of there. `
`0x43003cc3`; `You’ll need a speedy exfil for sure. I’ll get Blaster working on that now!`
`0x43003cc4`; `You know me! I'm all over it.`
`0x43003cc5`; `Don’t remind me.`
`0x43003cc6`; `Warning. Entering the machine processing area. Extreme danger ahead.`
`0x43003cc7`; `Woah-h. What just happened? I'm heading to machine processing.`
`0x43003cc8`; `Ready to rock n roll, D!`
`0x43003cc9`; `Yeeeehaaaa!!!`
`0x43003cca`; `Okay, I’m on my way to chip manufacturing.`
`0x43003d28`; `We’re gonna tear the house down, D!`
`0x43003d29`; `Darwin - you have to get into the depot offices. Then hack into one of the production computers to get the factory plans. Power up the conveyor belt - it’s the easiest way in.`
`0x43003d2a`; `I’m on it.`
`0x43003d2e`; `Can everyone give me an update?`
`0x43003d2f`; `Okay Darwin - I’m at Saber’s office and I have his laptop.`
`0x43003d30`; `Great work - see if you can hack in.`
`0x43003d31`; `Hey Juarez - send me an IM!`
`0x43003d32`; `Like ‘get lost’?`
`0x43003d33`; `Listen. I can help Juarez.`
`0x43003d34`; `What do you mean Speckles?`
`0x43003d35`; `If I can link Saber’s laptop to the Main Computer Core, we’ll have total access to Saber’s files.`
`0x43003d36`; `I know. Just wish me luck.`
`0x43003d37`; `Speckles - wait! Speckles?`
`0x43003d38`; `He’s gone, Darwin.`
`0x43003d39`; `Excellent. The office containing the plans is on the first floor.`
`0x43003d76`; `Um, you got it... nowhere to go anyway!`
`0x43003d77`; `Grapple’s gonna come in handy here.`
`0x43003d78`; `I'm here at the core, Darwin. Starting to work on the virus now.`
`0x43003d79`; `Great. We’re still on track to bring this place down... so let’s do it.`
`0x43003db9`; `Attention - Monorail One is now ready for departure. Station doors now opening.`
`0x43003dba`; `Attention: departure of all monorails has been cancelled.`
`0x43003dbb`; `Specks, I need a route through to the cargo hold.`
`0x43003dbc`; `The cargo lines can be reversed by switching the Power Cores. Try taking the Power Core out of one Socket and placing it in the other.`
`0x43003dbd`; `Remember Mooch can also handle those Power Cores.`
`0x43003dbe`; `Excellent work Darwin - you now have a free ride into the hold.`
`0x43003dbf`; `The monorail shipment for New York and all points east is now ready for departure.`

`0x43003dc5`; `All Monorails at the loading docks will now commence loading procedures.`
`0x43003dc6`; `Wow, looks like production is in full swing, Saber sure has been busy.`
`0x43003dc7`; `It certainly is an impressive sight. You’re going to have to hitch a ride to the opposite side of this hanger - that should lead you directly into the main Storage Depot and subsequently those factory plans.`

`0x43003722`; `And I'm, er, ready for my fill too!`
`0x43003723`; `Okay, let’s head to the video security room and see if we can get a fix on where they have Saber. Total radio silence in effect until we’re in - starting... now!`
`0x43003729`; `Hey, catch that, Juarez? The appliances just moved right past FBI Security, no problem. Saberling’s stuff must have total clearance here. But I sure don’t.`

`0x43003734`; `That fridge has frozen the whole room. It’s like an ice rink here.`
`0x43003735`; `Yeah, everything’s iced solid here too. Talk about chillin' - colder than Juarez!`

`0x43003739`; `I’m checking! `
`0x4300373a`; `I can’t do anything from here to get that door open. You’ll have to find another way in. Maybe you can get outside the building from the Director’s office.`
`0x4300373b`; `You mean go... out of the building?`

`0x43003740`; `The security door there will open only for a Saberling appliance.`
`0x43003741`; `So time to do some vacuuming, huh? Blaster - sit rep?`

`0x43003745`; `All cats are ugly. And that sound they make? Me-ow? What is with that?`
`0x43003746`; `Why anyone would hang a picture of cat...`
`0x43003747`; `Blaster - any ideas on getting to the other side of the building?`
`0x43003748`; `Yeah, you got to get to the top of that ledge above you... then zip line across. I should be able to give you a bit of boost with the elevator.`
`0x43003749`; `More heights? Great...`
`0x4300374a`; `Come on Darwin - this is fun!`
`0x4300374b`; `Okay, Blaster - going up!`
`0x4300374c`; `You’re on your way, Darwin. Next floor - sporting goods and swim wear.`
`0x43003755`; `I’m at the door - but it has a keycard lock. `
`0x43003756`; `Then there has to be a keycard nearby. Maybe check the supply offices?`
`0x43003757`; `Juarez - any update?`
`0x43003758`; `Nothing on Saber’s location. But I have an idea. If we can uplink your IR equipment to the building's security, I should be able to triangulate the location of the real Saber.`
`0x43003759`; `Good work - so what do I do?`
`0x4300375a`; `That’s the hard part. You must get to the nearest Security Uplink station... and that’s inside the bureau’s High Tech Crimes division. Probably has a high security door... and no telling what else you’ll face.`
`0x4300375b`; `Other than that... it’s a walk in the park.`
`0x4300375c`; `Darwin, there's one mean paper shredder guarding the door ahead. But I think I have a way you can get past it.`
`0x4300375d`; `And that is?`
`0x4300375e`; `Okay, there’s one of those Holo-Scanners right near you. It’ll make a Holo-disc version of you, Darwin. Throw it in front of those crazy appliances and they’ll ignore you completely. As long as your clone keeps running, should work like a charm!`
`0x4300375f`; `Blaster... sometimes you are absolutely brilliant.`
`0x43003760`; `What do you mean only sometimes? Good luck Darwin!`
`0x43003761`; `Juarez, it’s getting really cold here.`
`0x43003762`; `Something’s wrong with the cooling system.`
`0x43003763`; `Do you know a way to...`
`0x43003764`; `Oh, a little cold, and you with all that nice warm fur. My toys have been playing with the cooling system. I'm afraid it’s going to get even colder. You better keep moving, guinea pig.`
`0x43003765`; `Juarez, I reached the High Tech Crimes division. But I’m going to need a keycard to access the area.`
`0x43003766`; `There’s a security booth in the next room, they’ll have one, but you’ll need to use the terminal to get in there. Any motion sensors around?`
`0x43003767`; `I see one... Bet I can use it to get the power up and running.`
`0x43003768`; `But Darwin - there’s no direct line of sight. You’ll have to bend or bounce the beams. Won't be easy.`
`0x43003769`; `Juarez, nothing’s been easy today.`
`0x4300376c`; `Okay Darwin, the Security Uplink station should be just there, right to your...`
`0x4300376d`; `You two are getting so tiresome. You see, I can not lose this game, not now. Mr Saber is completely cornered by my machines. Do not worry. When they get to him... it will all be quite quick!`
`0x4300376e`; `Keep talking, Yanshu. Sounds like you're the one who’s starting to worry!`
`0x4300376f`; `Juarez. I’ve got my IR system uplinked to Security.`
`0x43003770`; `Great. Hold on... there. Got Saber! He's not far away... only two floors down. I've opened the office so you can get in. But you’ll have to go outside again to get to him in time.`
`0x43003771`; `Outside? Blaster - you there? I was hoping you had a handy vent I could use.`
`0x43003772`; `Sorry D... no vents near you. Go on out there... you know you love it!`
`0x43003773`; `Riiiight!...`
`0x43003774`; `Darwin - good work. Saber is located in one of the elevators just a few floors above you. If you get into the adjacent elevator I should be able to patch your comms directly to him.`
`0x43003775`; `Good! Blaster, report?`
`0x43003776`; `Checking for alternates in the area Darwin. If there are any other ways in or out... I’ll find them!`
`0x43003777`; `Keep me posted!`
`0x43003778`; `So Darwin, leader of the great G-Force... I must say you are very persistent. Unfortunately you are coming to the end of this trail, very soon.`
`0x43003779`; `No Yanshu, not the end of the trail... the end of you.`
`0x4300377a`; `How vexing. Thought for sure the firing range would stop you cold. No matter, everything is locked up tight and you can expect company... right about... now!`
`0x4300377b`; `Impressive. And I do not impress easily. I must admit you are dealing admirably with every test I throw your way.`
`0x43003780`; `Such dogged persistence. All wasted. What a pity.`
`0x43003781`; `I'm closing in, Yanshu. You’re just about done here...`
`0x43003782`; `Not exactly... I’m afraid the ending won’t be what you expect.`
`0x43003783`; `Oh, really - will it be even better? `
`0x43003784`; `Goodbye, Rodent!`
`0x43003785`; `Juarez, Yanshu has sabotaged the elevator controls.`
`0x43003786`; `Any ideas?`
`0x43003787`; `Got one. I could get on top of the elevator and get it moving somehow.`
`0x43003788`; `Hey, pret-ty amazing... I actually got the elevator moving.`
`0x43003789`; `Good - patching you into Saber’s elevator. Get him to go to the ground floor stat!`
`0x4300378a`; `Mr. Saber - FBI here. I'm going to free your elevator. Then take it down to the...`
`0x4300378b`; `Er, yes - take the elevator to the roof, Mr. Saber - and hurry!`
`0x4300378c`; `Juarez, who is that? That sounds like.. that sounds like me talking to Saber!`
`0x4300378d`; `We will have a chopper all ready to take you to safety, Mr. Saber.`
`0x4300378e`; `Someone in the building has stolen the feed - and they have digitally copied your voice!`
`0x4300378f`; `Yanshu’s going down hard! Can you crack into it?`
`0x43003790`; `Afraid not. It’s heavily encrypted.`
`0x43003919`; `I’m at the elevator - but the control terminal’s offline.`
`0x4300391a`; `All secure terminals shut down if a security breach is detected.`
`0x4300391b`; `Great - so we need to get power to this system somehow?`
`0x4300391c`; `Yes, the energy from a motion sensor beam may work, be careful though.`
`0x4300391d`; `Darwin, you’ll need to attract the motion sensor beam and then get it to hit the optic switch.`
`0x4300391e`; `Saber's gone, Darwin!`
`0x4300391f`; `Looks like someone doesn’t want him to talk.`
`0x43003920`; `He said ‘Yanshu’...`
`0x43003921`; `Yanshu... right, Saber’s mysterious partner. Keep trying to track Saber. We need answers. `
`0x43003923`; `But why should we work against each other? Do you really care about those who treat you so poorly? Just think of the havoc we could reap together. Humanity wouldn’t know what hit it.`
`0x43003924`; `Such bravado. Beware of surprises, little guinea pig. I gave you a chance. And I’m afraid it was a one-time offer.`
`0x43003925`; `Juarez I’ve located the elevators - but my access here is all iced up.`
`0x43003926`; `Hold on, okay... head into the restrooms... yes, the restrooms. There’s a route there that will take you into the maintenance area and loop you back to the elevators.`
`0x43003927`; `Gracias Juarez, heading back now!`
`0x43003931`; `Saber’s trapped on the Helicopter pad, and it looks suspiciously quiet.`
`0x43003932`; `Darwin, hold fire till we get there.`
`0x43003933`; `I don’t think we have time... wish me luck guys.`
`0x43003936`; `Darwin, that looks like one cool ride - you get all the best assignments!`
`0x43003937`; `Yeah, sure Blaster... I am soooo lucky. Juarez, anything from Specks yet?`
`0x43003a67`; `Darwin, my scans indicate a data disk for a prototype Flame Thrower weapon in this area. You’re gonna need this if we’re going to get to Saber... `
`0x43003abf`; `That door... I can't get access, my guess is that the mechanism is broken.`
`0x43003ac0`; `I’ll have to find some other way through...`
`0x43003b44`; `Only for you, Blaster.`
`0x43003b45`; `Ditto!`
`0x43003b46`; `Nothing yet.`
`0x43003c22`; `Okay - there’s the control room and there's the guard... and that’s a problem!`
`0x43003c23`; `Hey, Hurley, think you can do something to get the guard to come out?`
`0x43003c24`; `You just watch!`
`0x43003c25`; `Yoo-hoo.`
`0x43003c26`; `What the?`
`0x43003c27`; `What’s up?`
`0x43003c28`; `You gotta be kidding!`
`0x43003c29`; `It’s me again!`
`0x43003c2a`; `That’s just wrong!`
`0x43003c2b`; `Security, you're not going to believe this... but we got a rodent problem down here in Sector 4B. I’m going to investigate it now!`
`0x43003c2c`; `Juarez, hack into this system and find Saber.`
`0x43003c2d`; `Count on it.`
`0x43003c2e`; `Got him! There's Saber!`
`0x43003c2f`; `I tell you - I don't know what has happened.`
`0x43003c30`; `Just tell us how to make those waffle irons and toasters stop attacking everyone.`
`0x43003c31`; `I keep telling you. I don't know. Unless... unless...`
`0x43003c32`; `Unless... it was Yanshu. He could...`
`0x43003c33`; `Enough from you, Mr. Saber. Time to bring our working relationship to an end.`
`0x43003c34`; `Who is this? Identify yourself.`
`0x43003c35`; `Why don’t I show you instead...?`
`0x43003c36`; `Evac! Go... go... go! Everyone out of here now!`
`0x43003c37`; `Juarez... I... I see Saber!`
`0x43003c38`; `Hold on, Darwin. I'm getting some funny readings. Not sure that-`
`0x43003c39`; `I don’t suppose you want to surrender? Do not worry, I have Mr Saber’s retirement plan all worked out! Though I’m afraid it won’t be much fun for him!`
`0x43003c3d`; `Ready to give up, rodent? If not, I have more surprises... all ready and waiting just for you.`
`0x43003c3e`; `I'm afraid your new toy won't help you much.`
`0x43003c3f`; `Guys - got a big problem here.`
`0x43003c40`; `Trapped like a rat. It's the fate you chose, Darwin.`
`0x43003c41`; `Juarez, I freed Saber's elevator. Mr. Saber, Mr. Saber! Can you hear me. You must head to the ground-`
`0x43003c42`; `Mr. Saber, don't listen to that impostor’s voice above you. Get to the roof as fast as you can.`
`0x43003c43`; `No. Mr. Saber, trust me. That's Yanshu speaking! You must get to the ground floor!`
`0x43003c44`; `That’s a trap Mr. Saber... don’t listen to him! A chopper is flying to the roof now!`
`0x43003c45`; `There is no chopper, Mr. Saber... don’t do it!`
`0x43003c46`; `Enough! I... I'm heading to the roof... now! Tell the chopper I’m coming!`
`0x43003c47`; `There’s Saber! He’s walking right into a trap!`
`0x43003c48`; `Wh... what’s going on...?`
`0x43003c49`; `Okay, listen Mr. Saber... you’re safe now. Tell me: how do we stop SaberSense?`
`0x43003c4a`; `Th... this isn’t SaberSense, not the way it was supposed to be. Yanshu twisted everything.`
`0x43003c4b`; `But how do we stop it?`
`0x43003c4c`; `Only by destroying the SaberSense satellite communications... at my complex.`
`0x43003c4d`; `And that will stop SaberSense worldwide?`
`0x43003c4e`; `Yes! Wh... where are you?`
`0x43003c4f`; `Don’t worry... you just wait there. Agents are on their way.`
`0x43003c50`; `G-Force... time to rendezvous and finish SaberSense off once and for all.`
`0x43003c51`; `Darwin. I got a fix on Yanshu’s signal. He’s in the satellite center itself! `
`0x43003c52`; `Finally we get to meet the mysterious Yanshu... face to face...`
`0x43003c53`; `Ah welcome guinea pig. And welcome to my small surprise. A final trap. Nowhere to go, for you or Saber. And all my pets... so eager to play.`
`0x43003c54`; `Time to give up, Darwin. Oops - so sorry. The time for ‘giving up’ has passed. Nothing you can do now, I am afraid... nothing at all.`
`0x43003c55`; `You’re sounding a bit desperate, Yanshu? Getting worried?`
`0x43003c56`; `Don’t you wish. I have it planned down to every detail.`
`0x43003c57`; `Good. I just love wrecking plans.`
`0x43003c58`; `Oh, but this time you are all part of that plan. If only you knew, you simple-minded rodent.`
`0x43003c59`; `Simple minded rodent? Yanshu - you have no idea who I am... but get ready to find out!`
`0x43003c5a`; `Oh, what is it your type always says... bring it on!`
`0x43003c5b`; `You’re out matched - you can’t hurt that microwave! It’s all over.`
`0x43003c5c`; `It’s over when I say it is. I’m just getting started...`
`0x43003c5d`; `The microwave shell is way too tough for your weapons, Darwin. There has to be another way of bringing it down.`
`0x43003c5e`; `Wait... if you can get something inside the microwave, it may find it hard to swallow.`
`0x43003c5f`; `Try this... throw a power core right into the microwave when it opens its door - the reaction should be enough to blow it up from the inside. Worth a shot!`
`0x43003ca3`; `Let’s find that nutcase, D!`
`0x43003ca4`; `Ready for the infil.`
`0x43003ca5`; `Least you know what floor he's on. Good hunting!`
`0x43003ca7`; `Maybe you can use that? Darwin - not to worry you, but haven’t had an update from Speckles in a while.`
`0x43003ca8`; `If I know Specks he’s lost himself to figuring out how to bring down Saber’s computer. I'm moving on...`
`0x43003d25`; `A partnership. With you, Yanshu? You’re talking to the wrong mammal. You’re going down.`
`0x43003d26`; `Give it a shot, Darwin! By the way, still trying to get a signal from Speckles. So far nothing.`
`0x43003d27`; `Keep trying....`
`0x43003d63`; `Great work Darwin. The Flame Thrower will make light work of all the ice around here. Now get the keycard.`
`0x43003d64`; `Got the data disk. Heading to a kiosk now - then we can start warming this party up!`
`0x43003d65`; `Roger Darwin.`
`0x43003daa`; `Attention... emergency exit opening.`
`0x43003fe2`; `Juarez, see if you can track the source of the hologram. Finding the real Leonard Saber just got a lot harder...`

`0x43003833`; `Something is making so-called space ‘junk’ fall to Earth. Authorities are warning everyone to stay inside, and to—`
`0x43003834`; `You getting this? It’s coming right at us. It’s gonna hit here—run!`
`0x43003835`; `Well -- a guest come to visit…come on in, Darwin. I do think it is time we met…face…to face. You do like surprises, don't you?`
`0x43003836`; `Speckles. No, you can’t be—`
`0x43003837`; `Yanshu, oh yes I can be. The mysterious Yanshu who unleashed the horror of Sabersense. One—and the same.`
`0x43003838`; `But why?`
`0x43003839`; `Have you ever searched on the net for the word ‘mole’, Darwin…There’s thousands of pages showing how to trap them…how to kill them. Guess what? Now it’s humanity’s turn.`
`0x4300383a`; `I can’t let you do this, Speckles.`
`0x4300383b`; `You…can’t? You still think you can stop me? Too bad , Darwin. You have picked your side. You will stand…and perish with them!`
`0x4300383c`; `It all begins….now`
`0x43003840`; `Juarez. You getting my video feed? And Blaster, can you see this?  `
`0x43003841`; `I see it nice and clear, Darwin. Looks like a data disk.`
`0x43003842`; `If it’s here, under all this high security there must be a reason. Juarez, any ideas?`
`0x43003843`; `I’m sending the signal direct to Ben... he might know what it is. But you’re right. If it’s here, it must be important.`
`0x43003844`; `The NanoHacker is based on the same tech as the Saberlizer. It uses nanotechnology to temporarily infect the targeting circuits of the SaberSense chip... and... makes the appliances attack each other! `
`0x43003845`; `Then that’s going to be one mighty useful gadget.`
`0x43003846`; `Darwin, be careful. I can't be sure what it will do. You’re going to have to try it and see what it does to each enemy.`
`0x43003847`; `Darwin, you have a good opportunity here to test the upgraded NanoHacker. Take a shot at one of the vacuums... and see what it does.`
`0x4300384a`; `O-kay. Here goes nothing...`
`0x4300384b`; `There you go, Darwin! Now you should be able to get past all the vacuums. Okay, keep the NanoHacker ready... and you know I bet the pressure from the nozzle is powerful enough to propel you into the air if you need it!`
`0x4300384c`; `Just an idea, Darwin... but I bet a projectile fired from the vacuum might help you get out of there and to the exit fast. Worth - as they say - a shot.`
`0x4300384d`; `You do get some wild ideas... I’ll try it`
`0x4300384e`; `Juarez... the code to open the door has to be on one of these computers... but something has made them go crazy. The data’s just flying by too fast to read.`
`0x4300384f`; `How about you use Mooch! He sees the world a lot slower then the rest of us. He should be able to read the combination.`
`0x43003850`; `Great idea. Thanks!`
`0x43003851`; `Darwin, we have to shut down the satellite control center fast. There should be a computer terminal up ahead that’s linked to the CCTV. I’m picking up lifeform readings - it’s the scientists from the chip production facility.`
`0x43003852`; `I’ll see what they have to say.`
`0x43003860`; `Okay, Juarez. I’ve reached the communication control. But I’ve got to get up to the satellite dishes... What’s the best way forward?`
`0x43003861`; `There’s gotta be a door controlled by a keycard in that room. Just activate it and ride the elevator.`
`0x43003862`; `Thanks! Couldn’t do this without you. `
`0x43003863`; `Juarez... Yanshu is doing a better than good job of keeping me away from those sat dishes. In other words... I'm trapped. Any ideas, guys?`
`0x43003864`; `Hey D, the NanoHacker might be ideal for this situation! Try it out and see what happens! `
`0x43003865`; `Great plan, Blaster. I’ll do just that!`
`0x4300386c`; `Heading to the satellite complex now. How we doing team? `
`0x4300386d`; `Making progress on Yanshu’s signal!`
`0x4300386e`; `And I'm keeping all the exfils clear, Mr. D!`
`0x4300386f`; `And I’m standing by too, Darwin.`
`0x43003872`; `Juarez, I’m in the control room now. Guess what? The power is off. Getting to this dish isn’t going to be as easy as planned `
`0x43003873`; `Okay, I’ve found the generator for the control room. But I'm going to need some power cores to get it running again. Juarez, can you do a scan?`
`0x43003874`; `Doing it now... okay... got ‘em. They’re nearby. I've marked their location on your mission computer. `
`0x43003875`; `Thanks - I’ll start looking now!`
`0x43003876`; `Juarez, you got an image of this door? It has a button combination. Can you help?`
`0x43003877`; `Sorry, D... My guess is the codes are auto-generated by the consoles, and routed to anyone cleared for access. Which definitely isn't you. You’ll have to get to a console and hack it for the code.`
`0x43003878`; `Got it.`
`0x43003879`; `Whoa. I've hacked in but the codes are flying by too fast for me to see.`
`0x4300387a`; `Okay. I’ve got the last power core. Time to see if this gets the area on-line, and I can access that last dish.`
`0x4300387b`; `Darwin... looks like it worked. Energy readings are at full strength!`
`0x4300387c`; `Then I’m heading back to the control room.`
`0x4300387d`; `You should be able to get access to the satellite dish using the central console. Good luck!`
`0x4300387e`; `Whoa - you guys see the size of this dish? A lot bigger than I thought.`
`0x4300387f`; `The bigger they are, D.`
`0x43003880`; `Any ideas on how to bring it down?`
`0x43003882`; `Confirmed. I can see them from here. Anything else?`
`0x43003883`; `Darwin, once you remove them... it will start shutting down. But you better find a way to destroy the main dish in case Yanshu reactivates it.`
`0x43003884`; `Got it. I've learned to always expect the unexpected with Yanshu.`
`0x43003885`; `I don’t know what you’ll face Darwin -- take care.`
`0x43003886`; `That goes for me too D. You’ve come this far—time to finish it!`
`0x43003887`; `Nice one Darwin! One down, and one to go. Now head over to the opposite side of the control area.`
`0x43003888`; `On my way!`
`0x43003889`; `Satellite link-up shutting down. Please stand clear.`
`0x4300388a`; `Great work! Now climb up onto the main dish and destroy the three energy pylons.`
`0x4300388b`; `We’ve come this far... time to finish it`
`0x4300388c`; `You persistent and irritating rodent. You just won't give up, will you? But no matter - surely you have guessed that I have backups that make everything you do useless! And you certainly won’t guess what's about to happen next!`
`0x4300388d`; `Next? Blaster, Juarez... do you have any idea what that maniac Yanshu is talking about?`
`0x4300388e`; `The fool’s just bluffin’`
`0x4300388f`; `No idea - but you hurry outta there! The emergency hatch down there is your quickest route back to the central elevator.`
`0x43003891`; `Darwin... wait! I'm getting a reading that Yanshu is right there... at your location!`
`0x4300392b`; `Good idea, Juarez…I’ll need all the help I can get. Keep me posted!`
`0x4300392c`; `Are you sure about this? `
`0x4300392d`; `Glad I was right. The vacuum’s safe now so you should be able to take over its controls. Try going close to it, go ahead.`
`0x43003c65`; `Did you see what those Saberling appliances are doing? Crazy, huh?`
`0x43003c66`; `I wouldn’t want to be a shareholder in Saberling after this, they’ll... `
`0x43003c67`; `Wait! Look up there! Something in the sky, meteors or...`
`0x43003c68`; `Jeff! Come here quick... the news is showing things... falling from space.`
`0x43003c6a`; `Whoa, this is cool. And what is this stuff that's falling...? "space junk"?`
`0x43003c6b`; `Hey. Can you hear me? `
`0x43003c6c`; `Who is that? `
`0x43003c6d`; `Oh um. I‘m with a special unit called, um, G-Force. I could use some help here... like, how do I shut down this control center, and fast? `
`0x43003c6e`; `G-Force eh? You sound awfully familiar... `
`0x43003c6f`; `Clock’s ticking guys...`
`0x43003c70`; `OK! Here's what you do... disable the main satellite dish that the Saberling network uses to control the appliances worldwide. Once you do that, we can shut down that entire wing of the building. And that... should end this madness.`
`0x43003c71`; `We'll send you a keycard now so you can open the door in there. Good luck.`
`0x43003c72`; `A.. are you sure that’s a good idea, Elaine? I mean, what if it’s intercepted?`
`0x43003c73`; `Intercepted? It won't be intercepted! You are such a worrier! Alright, G-Force man, get ready! `
`0x43003c74`; `Darwin—wait---I'm getting a reading that Yanshu is right there…at your location!`
`0x43003c75`; `Well... a guest come to visit... leaving so soon Darwin? I do think it is time we met... face... to face. You do like surprises, don't you?`
`0x43003c76`; `Speckles. No, you can’t be?`
`0x43003c77`; `Yanshu, oh yes I can be. The mysterious Yanshu who unleashed the horror of SaberSense. One... and the same.`
`0x43003c78`; `But why?`
`0x43003c79`; `Have you ever searched on the net for the word "mole", Darwin? There’s thousands of pages showing how to trap them... how to kill them. Guess what? Now it’s humanity’s turn!`
`0x43003c7a`; `I can’t let you do this, Speckles.`
`0x43003c7b`; `You... can’t? You still think you can stop me? Too bad, Darwin. You have picked your side. You will stand... and perish with them!`
`0x43003c7c`; `It all begins... now`
`0x43003c7d`; `What in the...`
`0x43003c7e`; `We've got to move fast. Everyone... ideas!`
`0x43003c7f`; `Scanning the thing now. It’s made up of Saberling appliances! Got to get into the very core of it... to have even a chance of bringing it down.`
`0x43003c80`; `No way! How can we do that? That thing’s massive. You’d need a plane to get to it!`
`0x43003c81`; `Right. Only one way to get to it. Mooch, old buddy... we got to send you in there. It’s down to you.`
`0x43003cb3`; `Good. Let’s wrap this mission up!`
`0x43003cb4`; `Darwin remember those vacuums can be NanoHacked and they’re tied in to the building’s security. Could be useful!`
`0x43003cb5`; `I wonder if they’re also good for cleaning rugs?`
`0x43003cb6`; `I wouldn’t know that... unless you count Blaster as a rug...`
`0x43003cb7`; `Hey... you said that would remain between us!`
`0x43003cb8`; `I did say sorry!`
`0x43003ccf`; `Last act, guys. I’ve reached the satellite complex basement. Sit-rep?`
`0x43003cd0`; `Scanning the satellite complex for Yanshu’s signal. Closing in on it. I am also picking up high power readings from the basement area - this could be worth investigating before you enter the complex .`
`0x43003cd1`; `I'm a little busy playing with some evil toasters here... but don’t worry - I’ll get to your position soon!`
`0x43003cd2`; `The schematics indicate that you will have to enter the complex via the lower access doors. I will mark them on your mission computer. `
`0x43003cd3`; `Thanks Ben and... I'm heading in now...`
`0x43003d6d`; `Just got some intel from the Saberling database... The schematics show that the dish is controlled by two power cores at the base of the pillar.`
`0x43003d7c`; `I have the disk, it looks like plans for some sort of weapon upgrade.`
`0x43003d7d`; `Sounds interesting. Buy it and we'll take a closer look.`
`0x43003d7e`; `I’m on it.`
`0x43003d7f`; `The upgrade to the nanotechnology allows the NanoHacker to infect the targeting circuits of invulnerable enemies.`
`0x43003d80`; `Thanks for the intel Ben. With all these vacuums around here it’s gonna be my new best friend...`
`0x43003d81`; `Darwin, get that upgrade and lets see what it is capable of.`
`0x43003d82`; `Have you got the upgrade for the NanoHacker yet Darwin? It could prove to be useful. `
`0x43003dad`; `That’s got it! Now you’ll need to lower the access ladder to reach the top of the dish, although I’m pretty sure Yanshu’s not going to make this easy...`
`0x43003dae`; `Agreed, it’s way too quiet out there. I see a way to get at it. If I can make this quick, maybe I’ll beat him to the punch.`
`0x43003fd8`; `Security Code`
`0x43003fe3`; `...so called "space junk" falling to earth. I believe we can go to some amateur footage...`
`0x43003fe4`; `Oh man – they're heading straight for us. They're gonna hit! Come on... lets get outta here!`
`0x43004022`; `Heading into the satellite control room now. How we doing team? `
`0x43004023`; `I don’t think so Darwin. It’s time for you to witness the true power of my ultimate creation...`
`0x43004024`; `Yanshu!`
`0x4300415e`; `To Satellite Dish`
`0x430043d2`; `Holographic Display Prism: Glass display can be rotated using a nearby manual override wheel.`
`0x430043d3`; `Secure Cabinet: Cabinet is locked but can be opened by replacing the Power Cores in the base.`
`0x430043d4`; `Satellite Control Column: Column has been restored to proper alignment.`

`0x43003892`; `Mooch, my man - it’s all up to you now...`
`0x43003893`; `Mooch... you’ll have to get into the central core. It’s the only way we’ll have any chance of stopping this thing.`
`0x43003895`; `Okay Mooch—you have to insert the PDA right into the heart of Clusterstorm. Once you do—I can remotely trigger the virus upload from here.`
`0x43003896`; `It’s all up to you now Mooch!`
`0x43003897`; `Juarez... Mooch has overloaded the core! `
`0x43003898`; `I’m hacking in now. Keep your fingers crossed! Mooch - hustle out of there pronto!`
`0x430039da`; `Mooch, those things are out to destroy the cores! You have to stop them fast!`
`0x430039e1`; `Mooch... Okay, fill those power core sockets to overload the core. That should disable Clusterstorm’s defenses so we can control the satellite.`
`0x430039e2`; `And if we control the satellite, we can use it to destroy Clusterstorm. It’s down to you, Mooch! `
`0x430039e3`; `Gaahh, what’s this... a fly in the ointment? Nothing I can't swat. `
`0x430039e4`; `Great work Mooch! Get out of there pronto, were adjusting the satellites now!`
`0x43003b13`; `Yeah! Go for it little buddy!`
`0x43003b14`; `I’m ready to target Clusterstorm.`
`0x43003b15`; `Bring it down, D!`
`0x43003b16`; `Great work, Mooch... keep it up! `
`0x43003b17`; `I'm starting to get elevated energy readings, Mooch. You must be getting closer to the core!`
`0x43003b18`; `Careful, looks like a minefield ahead. You should be able to detonate those devices with the interference beam.`
`0x43003b19`; `Way to go,Mooch!`
`0x43003b1a`; `I’m reading a massive energy signature just ahead. Mooch, that must be the core! You’re close!`
`0x43003c82`; `What? How could you do that, only I - no it’s all... all... Aggghhhhhh...`
`0x43003c83`; `I still can’t believe it was Speckles all along...`
`0x43003c84`; `And you stopped him, Darwin!`
`0x43003c85`; `No Blaster. Speckles did it to himself.`
`0x43003c86`; `G-Force, exfil now! FBI is on the way.`
`0x43003c87`; `RDV time team!`
`0x43003c88`; `And Hurley... come on. You get to come too.`
`0x43003c89`; `G-Force!`
`0x43003c8a`; `Okay, sure. Everyone?`
`0x43003c8b`; `G-Force!`

`0x43003c8d`; `G-Force!`
`0x43003c8e`; `G-Force!`
`0x430039ed`; `Heads up - got a satellite dish barrier dead ahead blocking our way. `
`0x430039ee`; `Nice and slow guys - coming up to a little mine field.`
`0x430039ef`; `Whoa! I didn't see that coming! `
`0x430039f3`; `That’s one nasty roadblock ahead - watch those shredders! `
`0x430039f5`; `Getting a news feed coming through, patching it in...`
`0x430039f6`; `It is now confirmed that the unknown virus has affected appliances worldwide.`
`0x430039f7`; `Local authorities are now strongly advising everyone to avoid using or even being close to... all electrical appliances, until they can determine the cause of this strange phenomenon, and stop it.`
`0x430039f8`; `The clock is ticking it seems.`
`0x430039f9`; `No time to waste.`
`0x430039fa`; `I’m all set guys!`
`0x430039fb`; `Okay, G-Force – I've got a plan. We have to hit the distribution area first... and stop any more of these things from getting out. Then once that's done, we can take down the production plant.`
`0x430039fc`; `And Hurley... I gonna need you to hold position in the RDV... and keep watch `
`0x430039fd`; `Darwin, I must disagree with this plan of action. It's a clear breach of protocol. We should all focus on finding Saber. Ben, are you on the line?`
`0x430039fe`; `I'm here, Speckles.`
`0x430039ff`; `We should stay together until we understand the situation better. If I can get-`
`0x43003a00`; `No, no time for that, Speckles. Darwin - Speckles is right. It breaks protocol. But you’ve got a 'go' for your infil. Darwin, stop the chip production. Everyone \nelse - find Saber!\n`
`0x43003a01`; `Thanks, Ben. Okay team, get ready to break. I'll proceed to the factory infil point.`
`0x43003a02`; `Speckles, I’ll need your help with that.`
`0x43003a03`; `Absolutely Darwin - I’ll be your eyes and ears.`
`0x43003a04`; `You can see? I thought all moles-`
`0x43003a05`; `I would suggest that ‘thinking’ is probably not your forte. Or speaking for that matter`
`0x43003a06`; `Okay, okay. Everyone, to your positions. Ready... to disengage... now!`
`0x43003bbf`; `Let’s get outta here, D!`
`0x43003bc0`; `And stay close!`
`0x43003bc1`; `I think we shook them off. Okay, everyone regroup and then we better figure out what just happened back there...`
`0x430037dd`; `Darwin - I'm getting a video feed. Saber’s leaving the complex... in the company of the FBI.`
`0x430037de`; `The Feds got him before I did? Man!`
`0x430039f1`; `What? Heading down! `
`0x430039f2`; `Now this is fast!`
`0x43003a07`; `G-Force, then they’ll be taking him to FBI HQ.`
`0x43003a08`; `Dangerous as it is, we got to get in there and find out what Saber tells them... It’s the only way to stop this.`
`0x43003a09`; `Time for a road trip! Everybody hold on - especially you, Hurley!`
`0x43003c1e`; `Team break! Time to hustle out of here!`
`0x43003c1f`; `Time to show off my driving skills!`
`0x43003c20`; `You call them skills? Just don’t hit anything!`
`0x43003c21`; `Nice work guys - let’s regroup! `

`0x43003b50`; `Imagine a world where everything that helps us with common chores and tasks of daily life... can communicate with each other... and with us! You who are watching are indeed privileged to be able to witness the dawn of this new age, the age of SaberSense!`
`0x43003b51`; `Tonight, all around the world, everything changes with the launch of SaberSense in just minutes - and you will be able to watch it all from around the globe! `
`0x43003b52`; `It's not too much to say that this day will be recorded as the day life as we knew it changed forever.`
`0x43003b53`; `One last check-in with two key members on my on-site scientific team, Drs. Elaine and Elliot Stone.`
`0x43003b54`; `Is everything in order?`
`0x43003b55`; `The SaberSense satellite relays have all been activated, Mr. Saber, all in accordance with Yanshu’s instructions.`
`0x43003b56`; `And your factory’s chip production for the world-wide rollout is well ahead of Yanshu’s schedule. `
`0x43003b57`; `Fantastic. Then all is ready... When I press this simple button... the future arrives, and there can be no turning back.`
`0x43003b58`; `That's what he thinks, right Darwin?`
`0x43003b59`; `What the...? What just happened to the video link? This is impossible ... You...come with me now - and fast\n\n`
`0x43003b5a`; `Excellent work as usual, Darwin. I'm reading zero communications from the conference room. Couldn't have gone smoother.`
`0x43003b5d`; `Tonight, Leonard Saber will launch SaberSense worldwide, and with his private network of satellites, every Saberling appliance will immediately be linked and able to communicate with each other, and with their owners.`
`0x43003b5e`; `Okay, G-Force - you know what this SaberSense can really do. Agent Darwin, set the mission profile.`
`0x43003b5f`; `Affirmative, Ben. The FBI’s been tracking Leonard Saber’s top-secret work on SaberSense for years. But we know it has to be stopped, and it has to be stopped now. Questions? Okay-`
`0x43003b60`; `We make a full team insertion just outside the mansion. I’ll make a quick and clean infil at the garden... here. Once I reach the conference control room, Juarez, you will link with me to shut the system down and make sure SaberSense never launches. Blaster, you recce our possible exfils.`
`0x43003b61`; `FYI guys - Saber will have a lot of security. Remember your unit is covert. You do not exist. `
`0x43003b62`; `Invisible... invincible...`
`0x43003b63`; `We’re gonna bring that SaberSense down!`
`0x43003b64`; `Plan locked. Team ready? It’s... showtime!`
`0x43003b65`; `Hey... keep her steady, Blaster. `
`0x43003b66`; `Entry point locked. `
`0x43003b67`; `Team Break... now! `
`0x43003b68`; `Darwin, if you would be so kind.`
`0x43003b69`; `Oh yeah...`
`0x43003b6a`; `What the-? Elliot, your satellites are making the power supply spike all over the complex! You have to stop them now!`
`0x43003b6b`; `No, that can't be... let me check the backup systems.`
`0x43003b6c`; `This isn’t right at all. Come on!`
`0x43003b6d`; `Tommy, I told you it’s dinner time now, mister!`
`0x43003b6e`; `Okay, Mom! Mom, it's moving, my lamp's alive! It's flying!`
`0x43003b6f`; `And be sure to wash your hands before you come down.`
`0x43003b70`; `Help!`
`0x43003b71`; `Tonight’s launch of SaberSense by billionaire Leonard Saber will, Saber claims, forever change the way the whole world uses their appliances.`
`0x43003b72`; `Honey, did you take the garbage out yet? It's starting to smell.`
`0x43003b73`; `In a minute - I’m almost done here!`
`0x43003b74`; `What the...`
`0x43003b75`; `What did you just do?`
`0x43003b76`; `I didn’t do anything.`
`0x43003b77`; `The whole system's completely down.`
`0x43003c93`; `Use your scanner Darwin, let’s get some data to work with.`
`0x43003c94`; `Got one - a maintenance vent on the roof. I’ve updated your mission computer.`
`0x43003d3a`; `(coughing)`
`0x43003d3b`; `Now the phone’s dead!`
`0x43003d3c`; `What’s going on?`
`0x43003d3d`; `I... can’t... breathe!`
`0x43003d3e`; `Warning! Security Breach has been detected. All non-essential personnel should evacuate immediately...`
`0x43003d3f`; `Attention. This is an all systems alert. Repeat: an all systems alert.`
`0x43003d40`; `Attention: power surges have been detected throughout all areas. System override and shutdown has failed. Immediate evacuation is now recommended.`
`0x43003d6e`; `We have all the recording systems online and no problems, Mr. Saber.`
`0x43003fa6`; `Good riddance.`
`0x43003fa7`; `Ah, probably gone back to the kicthen - yuck!`
`0x43003fa8`; `The rat's gone…good thing!`
`0x43003fa9`; `Maybe it's one of them - I dunno - illusions.`
`0x43003faa`; `Ah, I give up. Thing's gone back to its rat home.`
`0x43003fab`; `Okay, mouse gone, back to my usual patrol.`
`0x43003fac`; `Sheeesh... thing just up and disappeared!`
`0x43003fad`; `Great--now the rodent can be someone else's problem.`
`0x43003fae`; `K... I looked, and it’s gone. Did my job!`
`0x43003faf`; `That thing moves pretty fast.`
`0x43003fc4`; `What the - that a rat!`
`0x43003fc5`; `Hey - some kind of mouse? `
`0x43003fc6`; `Can't they afford an exterminator here?`
`0x43003fc7`; `Great! Just what we need mice!`
`0x43003fc8`; `What - where did that furball come from?`
`0x43003fc9`; `Hey - uh, what is that thing?`
`0x43003fca`; `Gonna need some rodent traps!`
`0x43003fcb`; `Where'd that thing come from?`
`0x43003fcc`; `Huh - I'm gonna step on  that thing!`
`0x43003fcd`; `Is that a cat or somethin'?`
`0x43004038`; `What the...?`
`0x43004039`; `What just happened to the video link?`
`0x4300403a`; `This is impossible... You... come with me now - and fast!`
`0x43004072`; `I... can’t... breathe!\n\n`
`0x4300415f`; `To SaberSense! And to my friends around the world... turning points in history are few and far between.`
`0x43004160`; `This is a day of triumph, a day that will change the world... forever.`
`0x4300416b`; `Entry point locked. `
`0x43004328`; `Okay Mom!`
`0x43004329`; `Mom, it’s moving, my lamp’s alive! It’s flying!`
`0x4300353b`; `Buckle up, Darwin, this may get a little scary.`
`0x4300353c`; `Just in the nick of time.`
`0x4300353d`; `And just the way I like it. (a beat) Now I'm going to go real fast...so hold on!`
`0x4300353e`; `Those blasts are coming mighty close, Blaster.`
`0x4300353f`; `Don't worry D -- they can't touch us. Not with me driving!`
`0x430035ad`; `Listen --  I don't care what you have to do.....but find out what is going on now! What, huh?`
`0x430035ae`; `Yes, do whatever you have to do, then go--`
`0x430035ee`; `Darwin - where are you?`
`0x430035ef`; `Getting out now. Any sign of the SWAT team?`
`0x430035f0`; `Not yet. `
`0x430035f1`; `This is just plain weird, D!`
`0x430035f2`; `And a little deadly too...`
`0x430035f3`; `I wish Speckles was here!`
`0x430035f5`; `Whoa - the cavalry's definitely arrived.`
`0x430035f6`; `And picking up more SWAT all over the place!`
`0x430035f7`; `Guys, SaberSense is most definitely... activated! `
`0x430035f8`; `If that’s SaberSense, I’m staying away from appliances!`
`0x430035fb`; `Guess what? Saber’s down two cooks, and his waffle irons are after me.`
`0x430035fc`; `Hold the syrup - you have got to be kidding me!`
`0x43003602`; `Darwin? Hate to, like, rush you. But sounds like something really nasty's trying to get in!`
`0x43003603`; `Darwin - get a move on! That door isn't gonna hold up for long.`
`0x43003604`; `I hear you... but how can I stop that thing! If I open the elevator door Blaster’s a goner. How about a plan B!`
`0x43003605`; `Strange... there’s some kind of liquid on the floor.`
`0x43003606`; `Okay - Speckles. Got a nice view of the heating hub. I should be able to make my way there.`
`0x43003608`; `Alright, I see the central heating hub; but I don’t think it's a good idea to head in there... unless I want to get barbecued.`
`0x43003609`; `According to these building schematics, the center of the hub has the heating ducts for the whole complex. Following the correct one should... lead you right to the main Saberling offices. It's your only shot, Darwin.`
`0x4300360a`; `Hmm okay Specks - Juarez, the room's locked down. Any suggestions?`
`0x4300360b`; `Wish I could help... there's nothing I can do from this end. You'll need to find the shut-off valves. Check around the hub... there should be four of them.`
`0x4300360c`; `Warning! Heating system pressure has attained critical level. All heating valves require manual shut down immediately.`
`0x4300360d`; `Great- pressure’s dropping already. Only three more valves to go!`
`0x4300360e`; `Shutdown complete. Heating system now returning to normal.`
`0x4300360f`; `Good work, Darwin. Now you should be able to access the central computer area from there.`
`0x43003610`; `Are you sure?`
`0x43003611`; `Trust me - I know everything about this building. `
`0x43003615`; `Okay Juarez, Blaster - I’m in the Saberling Office reception area.`
`0x43003616`; `What’s your plan, Darwin?`
`0x43003617`; `I’ll have Mooch disable the lasers. Then I should be able to get in.`
`0x43003618`; `You go for it, Darwin!`
`0x4300361a`; `Darwin, I think there might be a shortcut through the Accounting offices, I can open the door for you...`
`0x4300361b`; `Roger that, Specks.`
`0x4300361e`; `Darwin? Report, are you ok?`
`0x4300361f`; `Things got a little hot, but I'm still in one piece.`
`0x43003620`; `...Sorry - those irons didn't show up on my scan. I'm going to have to recalibrate my equipment.`
`0x43003621`; `I’m okay. I’ll find another way around.`
`0x43003626`; `Okay, you’re still far from the computer room but you have a clear run to it from your current position. Blaster, can you for once hustle?`
`0x4300362e`; `Good news Darwin, I've located the speaker blueprints. They’re somewhere on this floor, i’ll be able to pinpoint the signal when you are closer.`
`0x4300362f`; `Thanks Juarez! `
`0x43003632`; `Darwin - Ben here. You have the Saberlizer?`
`0x43003633`; `Is that what this thing is?`
`0x43003634`; `Yeah, that's what I'm calling it. Okay, you can shoot it at any Saberling appliance and it should trigger the weaponization sequence. If you're careful you can then use the appliances to your advantage.`
`0x43003639`; `Okay Darwin - scans show that the blueprints are somewhere in that room. When you find them I can recalibrate your headset so the sonic waves don't touch you.`
`0x4300363a`; `If they’re here - I’ll find them.`
`0x4300363b`; `Juarez, I have the blueprints.`
`0x4300363c`; `Scanning now. Okay - just a sec... alright - your headset has been calibrated. You’re good to go!`
`0x4300363d`; `Great - back in the game. Thanks Juarez. I'm heading back to the computer center.`
`0x4300363e`; `Juarez, just a double-check before I re-enter the disco - can you confirm that my suit is ready?`
`0x4300363f`; `All recalibrated. No worries - you’re fully protected from the speakers’ sonic charge.`
`0x43003640`; `Great!`
`0x43003641`; `Hold on Juarez... I got a SWAT team down!`
`0x43003642`; `Checking their vitals. OK - pulse and respiration all normal. The speakers just rendered them unconscious.`
`0x43003643`; `Okay then, so there's no way I can get to the computer center... unless I mute that bad music!`
`0x43003644`; `Darwin - I've plotted a secure path for you directly to the computer core. Proceed straight ahead, then take the elevator to make your final infil right into the core center.`
`0x43003645`; `Closing in... good work.`
`0x43003646`; `Okay, I’m in the elevator. Sit-rep, team?`
`0x43003647`; `Situation’s all quiet here, Darwin.`
`0x43003648`; `Ready as ever for your exfil, D.`
`0x4300364a`; `Thanks, Speckles.`
`0x4300364d`; `Okay, I’m at the computer core control room. But the security door is sealed tight. Think you can crack it remotely, Speckles?`
`0x4300364e`; `Yes, of course I can. But we have a small problem. Saber has the codes stored on two secure servers, both heavily protected. No way I can access them from the network. Darwin. I'm afraid you're going to have to plant WiFi transmitters on each server to give me access.`
`0x4300364f`; `Copy that, Specks! `
`0x43003650`; `Speckles - can you give me a signal check? `
`0x43003651`; `Yes, receiving it loud and clear; only one more to go, Darwin.`
`0x43003652`; `Okay - both transmitters planted. You should be all set, Chief.`
`0x43003653`; `Confirming that. Now make your way back to the Security Door and just leave the rest to me.`
`0x4300382b`; `Darwin - those doors are locked. And my scans show no other way forward.`
`0x4300382c`; `Woah! I’m getting massive energy readings from that laser Darwin. It might be strong enough to destroy the doors... `
`0x4300382d`; `OK Darwin, you’ll need to follow those pipes through those vents. That should lead you to a way out of this place.`
`0x4300382e`; `Got to tell ya - looks real dark down there. But those pipes... they're heated, right? In infrared, they’ll glow like Christmas lights.`
`0x430038b2`; `There’s lots of stuff here but no way forward. What’s going on? I’m going to have to go back to the reception area and see if there is another way - Speckles, check your schematics again. I don’t want to be running around in circles.`
`0x430038b5`; `They’re emitting ultra high frequency waves. I’m going to search for the speaker blueprints so you can neutralize them...`
`0x430038b6`; `OK, my scans show that the blueprints are stored in the design wing of the complex. I’m updating your mission computer now...`
`0x430038b7`; `I always hustle! I’m almost there, D!`
`0x430038b8`; `Music to my ears...`
`0x430038bb`; `That's way too high, I'll never make it over...`
`0x430038bc`; `Hmm... that extractor fan's suction might just provide enough force. Jump into the stream, it should lift you high enough to make it over.`
`0x430038bd`; `Good thinking!`
`0x430038be`; `Getting into the hub might be tricky, but the jetpack could be of use here...`
`0x430038c6`; `Darwin - only one more valve left!`
`0x430038d6`; `Okay Darwin-just hack in, and I will upload the virus!`
`0x430038d7`; `Roger Speckles.`
`0x430038d8`; `This is it, Darwin. Bring ‘er down!`
`0x430038d9`; `Wait a second! The system shows that it's still online. The virus didn’t work? `
`0x430038da`; `Aborting the mission! G-Force— everyone ex-fil!`
`0x430038db`; `Getting out --now!`
`0x430038dc`; `Moving now Darwin! `
`0x430038dd`; `Hurley, Hurley – come in  Hurley?`
`0x430038de`; `Okay, okay -- I was looking for something to eat. `
`0x430038df`; `Hurley—get out of there! `
`0x430038e0`; `Jeeze-I’m leaving already!`
`0x430038e1`; `Guys I ….need some help…like now! `
`0x430038e2`; `Somebody, anybody…`
`0x430038e3`; `I am so done for...I’ve had my last lunchtime`
`0x430038e4`; `Hey!`
`0x430038e5`; `You should lose some weight, Porky.`
`0x430038e6`; `Yee-haw—Piece of cake.`
`0x430038e7`; `Let’s get out of here.`
`0x430038ea`; `Wait... if you open the door for the SWAT team then they’ll take that shredder out, right?`
`0x430038eb`; `Great plan B, Ms J! `
`0x430038ec`; `Okay, I’m all clear here. Moving on to plant the transmitters now.`
`0x430038ed`; `Darwin, sorry I didn’t pick up those appliances before they got to you.`
`0x430038ee`; `That's okay Specs - We'll be done soon and out of here!`
`0x430038ef`; `Darwin, this door’s about to pop! `
`0x430038f0`; `Just hang in there fur ball! Darwin’s on his way!`
`0x430039dc`; `Hey Darwin, now that you’re done playing with those things, how about getting me outta here! `
`0x43003a63`; `Yeah... OK, so I’m gonna look around for something I can Saberlize...`
`0x43003a64`; `Good idea...`
`0x43003a70`; `Darwin - nice work with the Saberlizer.`
`0x43003a71`; `My scans aren’t showing any appliances there at all. I’ll keep monitoring you all the way to the core.`
`0x43003a72`; `Hey - do you guys ever break for lunch?`
`0x43003a73`; `Hurley? Cut the chatter. Stand by for my infil into the Computer Core.`
`0x43003a89`; `Juarez, can you analyze what's going on with this door.`
`0x43003a8a`; `Checking... It’s not a normal door. The blueprints of the building show that it is some kind of Saberling device.`
`0x43003a8b`; `Darwin, I’m reading a Sabersense signal from the security door, why don’t you try the Saberlizer on it?`
`0x43003af2`; `You never were much in the kitchen.`
`0x43003af3`; `The game’s just changed. Focus guys!`
`0x43003af4`; `Right D - I’m getting the RDV now! Let’s boogie out of here!`
`0x43003af5`; `Juarez - please tell me the rest of the mansion’s quiet?`
`0x43003af6`; `Sorry D - the place is alive with signals.`
`0x43003af7`; `Great... Okay, everyone keep heading to the rendezvous. Blaster - how you doing?`
`0x43003af8`; `I’m in the elevator making my way to the RDV.`
`0x43003af9`; `Unit Three here... all clear in this sector.`
`0x43003afa`; `Roger that-we’ll continue our sweep of the area-over.`
`0x43003afb`; `All teams, stay close and everyone look alive now.`
`0x43003afe`; `Darwin, those speakers can do you some serious harm, you’ll need to get those blueprints before you can get past them.`
`0x43003aff`; `I’m doing my best guys!`
`0x43003b00`; `You’re doing great, Juarez. We all miss Specks - but we’ll manage... I'm almost out team.`
`0x43003b1b`; `Right... the schematics must have an error. I’ll double check. `
`0x43003b1c`; `Darwin - those barriers are closing in fast. Find a way out... now! `
`0x43003b27`; `Darwin, the torch is protected by shields, you’ll have to eliminate the satellites before you take it down. `
`0x43003b28`; `The torch missiles are designed to penetrate shields; try attracting its missiles towards the satellite barrier.`
`0x43003b29`; `Darwin, your weapons are no use.  You must attract one of the torch missiles to hit the satellite dish shield.  Only once all the satellite dishes are destroyed will the torch be vulnerable.`
`0x43003b2a`; `The barrier is down Darwin; time to take out that Torch!`
`0x43003b7b`; `Alright, move, move, move! Spread out through the house and look alive!`
`0x43003b7c`; `Huh?! What?`
`0x43003b7d`; `All units... we’re being attacked by a hostile... fan!`
`0x43003b7e`; `Unit 5 reporting... we’ve got hostile contact with... Saberling appliances.`
`0x43003b7f`; `Help! It’s after me!`
`0x43003b80`; `Contact!`
`0x43003b81`; `Okay - all units... Area clear! Be alert!`
`0x43003b82`; `I tell you, we throw away more food than Mr. Saber and his fancy friends eat.`
`0x43003b83`; `And all these appliances. The food practically cooks itself.`
`0x43003b84`; `Don't say that or we’ll be out of a job!`
`0x43003b85`; `Guys, hate to bother you. But I got a problem here. The elevator’s stopped cold, the door’s jammed and - I’m inside! You best go on without me.`
`0x43003b86`; `Command, we just took out... a paper shredder. Yeah - you heard me right - a shredder!`
`0x43003b88`; `Guys, I think my elevator ride is... over!`
`0x43003b89`; `Whoa, that was too close! Thanks for the rescue, Darwin. I owe you big time!`
`0x43003b8a`; `Forget it. You’d do the same for me.`
`0x43003b8b`; `Darwin - do I ever have a surprise for you.`
`0x43003b8c`; `Greetings, Darwin.`
`0x43003b8d`; `Speckles? What? I thought you were... what happened, old friend?`
`0x43003b8e`; `I adapted your plan for escape, Darwin, and managed with great difficulty to get out of that trash compactor in the, um, nick of time. But that’s a story for next time.`
`0x43003b8f`; `Understood Specks - great to have you back!`
`0x43003b90`; `As they say that is the good news; the bad is all of Saber's appliances have somehow become activated - each and every one. The place is alive with them.`
`0x43003b91`; `Any ideas?`
`0x43003b92`; `Yes - you have to get into the Central Computer and shut it down. And the best option is to head down to the basement by the laundry chute, and get past the heating hub. I’ll plot a course to guide you from there.`
`0x43003b93`; `Darwin - listen up! Ben says he has something that can help us. I’ll go rendezvous with him now!`
`0x43003b94`; `Not on my watch. Juarez, tell me how I can free Blaster! `
`0x43003b95`; `My scan shows that you can reach the control room at the end of the route you’re on. You should be able to free Blaster from there.`
`0x43003b96`; `Unit 5, status report? Unit 5, check in now! Unit 5 - what’s your situation!... Is anyone there?`
`0x43003b97`; `Sit-rep team?`
`0x43003b98`; `All set here to monitor your progress to the computer, Darwin.`
`0x43003b99`; `Listen up, D-I got some hot new gear from Ben and I’ll be with you in a New York minute!`
`0x43003b9a`; `Just don’t drop it.`
`0x43003b9b`; `And Darwin, keep us updated on your progress.`
`0x43003b9c`; `I’m eating now and, um, it’s going well. `
`0x43003b9d`; `Hurley - spare us, okay? `
`0x43003b9e`; `Surprise Mr D! Told you I’d be here. And look what I got for you!`

`0x43003ba0`; `And that’s good?`
`0x43003ba1`; `I'm sure you can figure it out, D!`
`0x43003ba2`; `Thanks - I guess...`
`0x43003ba3`; `Good luck with it, Darwin.`
`0x43003ba4`; `Darwin, I've just arrived on site. Where’s Blaster?`
`0x43003ba5`; `He’s on his way to rendezvous with you.`
`0x43003ba6`; `Yes, I was wondering if you could help me... yes... Where’s my taxi!`
`0x43003ba7`; `Five minutes is not good enough! Well let me tell you something Samantha, we have a big account with you... Like I care. Well fix it!`
`0x43003ba8`; `What the...? You have got to be kidding me...`
`0x43003ba9`; `Oh my... get 'em away from me... you... you... get 'em away... oh my... close the door... come on... come on!`
`0x43003baa`; `Okay, Speckles. I’m at the access door.`
`0x43003bab`; `Hang on... there. It should be open.`
`0x43003bac`; `You are a genius. Heading in!`
`0x43003bad`; `Okay Darwin - just hack in, and I will upload the virus!`
`0x43003bae`; `Roger Specks.`
`0x43003baf`; `This is it, Darwin. Bring ‘er down!`
`0x43003bb0`; `Wait a second! The system shows that it's still online. The virus didn’t work?`
`0x43003bb1`; `Aborting the mission! G-Force - everyone ex-fil!`
`0x43003bb2`; `Getting out - now!`
`0x43003bb3`; `Moving now Darwin!`
`0x43003bb4`; `Hurley, Hurley - come in Hurley?`
`0x43003bb5`; `Okay, okay - I was looking for something to eat. `
`0x43003bb6`; `Hurley - get out of there! `
`0x43003bb7`; `Okay, I'm leaving already!`
`0x43003bb8`; `Guys I... need some help... like now! `
`0x43003bb9`; `Somebody, anybody...`
`0x43003bba`; `I'm so done for...`
`0x43003bbb`; `Hey!`
`0x43003bbc`; `You should lose some weight, Porky.\n`
`0x43003bbd`; `Oh yeah! Piece of cake.`
`0x43003bbe`; `Let’s get out of here.`
`0x43003c95`; `Roger that—we’ll continue our sweep of the area—over.`
`0x43003c96`; `Blaster, you’ve been through there?`

`0x43003d70`; `Great - I love surprises.`
`0x43003d71`; `You know... I think it’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship...`
`0x43003d72`; `Good work, Darwin.`
`0x43003d73`; `Good to have you back, ole’ mole!`
`0x43003d74`; `And good... to be back. `
`0x43003d75`; `Okay. Now - I’m off to the Central Computer...`
`0x43003db0`; `You have got to be kidding me`

`0x4300356c`; `Just there, Darwin,`
`0x4300356d`; `Keep movin’, Darwin!`
`0x4300356e`; `Time to get this thing racing. Hang on.`
`0x4300356f`; `Do  I get to do that?`
`0x430035af`; `Everyone almost at the rendezvous point, team?`
`0x430035b0`; `Ready to rendezvous -- and rock n roll.`
`0x43003664`; `Okay, I made it inside the factory - where Saber makes his deadly toys and ships them in nice boxes worldwide.`
`0x43003666`; `Speckles, what’s my target?`
`0x43003667`; `Darwin - that’s a power core generator. The core generator powers devices all around the complex. You can attract and pull out the core using your Electro-Whip.`
`0x43003668`; `That’s another power core generator Darwin. If you pull the core out, you can use it to power up the socket on the conveyor.`
`0x4300366a`; `That’s a power core socket, Darwin. The sockets power devices all around the complex... but you’ll need to throw a power core inside to activate it.`
`0x4300366b`; `Go ahead, Darwin - now throw the power core right into the socket.`
`0x4300366e`; `Speckles, I'm in a jam here. No exit from this storage area. Any ideas?`
`0x4300366f`; `Yes... I can see a vent leading from one of the storage rooms. Use Mooch for a quick recon and locate the exit.`
`0x43003670`; `Mooch my man - stand by for your flying orders...`
`0x43003671`; `Okay, Speckles I’ve arrived at the main storage depot.`
`0x43003672`; `Good, the security feeds show offices just ahead. I can also see that the elevator is not working. Go see if you can get it up and running again.`
`0x43003673`; `Thanks for the heads-up, Speckles.`
`0x43003681`; `I’m on my way!`
`0x43003685`; `Okay, Darwin. Now that you have access to the production plant, you have to get into the machinery room and shut down the production machinery.`
`0x43003686`; `Copy that!`
`0x4300368f`; `Speckles, that might be risky - you’ll have to go back to the Core. That area is crawling with those appliances.`
`0x43003691`; `Juarez, can you confirm my target?`
`0x43003692`; `The entrance to the machinery room is dead ahead, Darwin. Leads right to the production facility. Get in there, and you should be good.`
`0x43003699`; `Hurley, I can see your position. Not too pretty! I'm on my way.`
`0x4300369a`; `Thanks Darwin!`
`0x4300369b`; `And Hurley? Don’t do anything... I mean anything! Just stay put...`
`0x4300369c`; `Hurley, the door’s locked. Juarez, gonna need another way in - and fast...`
`0x4300369d`; `I hear you. Scanning for an alternate point of ingress. Not sure I see anything...`
`0x4300369e`; `Hang in there, Hurley. If there's a way in, Darwin will find it!`
`0x4300369f`; `Wait I’m seeing a control room on the upper floor. You just might be able to open the door from there.`
`0x430036ab`; `OK Darwin, equip the Magnetic Grapple, it’s time for a field test.`
`0x430036ac`; `Aim the grapple right at that weaponized speaker unit you see up there on the ceiling. Just hold the fire button and you will be pulled toward the speaker.`
`0x430036ad`; `Excellent! Now you’re attached to the speaker you can switch freely to use your other weapons.`
`0x430036ae`; `You should be able to charge the jetpack while hanging from a speaker to reach new areas. Give it a try.`
`0x430036af`; `Thanks Juarez - those speakers are all over this place... gonna be really handy...`
`0x430036b2`; `Darwin, I’m getting some strange readings from your location. Energy fluctuations all over the place.`
`0x430036b3`; `A problem?`
`0x430036b4`; `I don’t know. But remember you have to power up the machinery to continue on the conveyor. And be careful.`
`0x430036b5`; `Yeah, careful D - cause you know Juarez really wants to see you again.`
`0x430036b6`; `Can it, Blaster!`
`0x430036b7`; `Okay Darwin, just checked and you have a tricky patch up ahead. You’ll have to activate all three power sockets to make the system overload.`
`0x430036b8`; `Got it.`
`0x430036bb`; `Great work, Darwin! You’ve overloaded the main constructor device... but now comes the hard part. You have to get to the chip production line and bring it down.`
`0x430036bc`; `Best way there?`
`0x430036bd`; `There's a cargo platform in the room opposite. That will bring you directly to chip production. But you need to work fast!`
`0x430036be`; `Speckles, what’s happening at the core?`
`0x430036bf`; `Still working on the virus... Saber has made some tricky modifications to the software. But I think I can crack it. Where are you now?`
`0x430036c0`; `Near the cargo platform, and ready to bring down the chip development area.`
`0x430036c1`; `Be careful Darwin-my scans aren’t showing me what you’ll find there.`
`0x430036c2`; `Stay tuned - I’ll let you know.`
`0x430036c3`; `You getting all this, Juarez?`
`0x430036c4`; `Darwin, that looks really dangerous. Be careful.`
`0x430036c5`; `Who knew washing machines were so complicated!`
`0x430036c6`; `I got a bad feeling about this. You sure there’s no way out of here?`
`0x430036c7`; `I’m looking...`
`0x430036c8`; `That was too close!`
`0x430036c9`; `The sky isn't falling but chunks of metal are!`
`0x430036ca`; `Oh great - somehow the appliances have found a way in here.`
`0x430036cb`; `Juarez, any clue what’s being manufactured around me?`
`0x430036cc`; `I’m checking on that...`
`0x430036cd`; `I think I'm... in the middle of a washing machine!`
`0x430036ce`; `This would be interesting if it wasn’t a trap!`
`0x430036cf`; `I'm running out of room here.`
`0x430036d0`; `Yes, it’s definitely a washing machine.`
`0x430036d1`; `Just don’t be inside when it gets turned on, D!`
`0x430036d2`; `I... think it’s done. And I’m okay!`
`0x430036d3`; `Great to hear, Darwin!`
`0x430036d4`; `And look at the plus side - now you know how they put washing machines together!`
`0x430036d5`; `Sit-rep guys. Blaster, any info on Saber?`
`0x430036d6`; `Still tracking him... but... we got some more company! The FBI is in the house!`
`0x430036d7`; `Stay out of their way, Blaster. Remember we’re working under deep cover here.`
`0x430036d8`; `You got it!`
`0x430036d9`; `Okay, Juarez - I’m at the chip production area. What do your scans show?`
`0x430036da`; `There are three phases in the chip production process, Darwin. You’ll have to shut them down in order, before you head onto the power generator.`
`0x430036db`; `Then that’s exactly what I’ll do sweet stuff. Heading to the first phase now...`
`0x430036dc`; `Darwin. Schematics show the next airlock close by. I’m working on locating it right now but first you need to shut down the first phase of production.`
`0x430036dd`; `I got a lock on Saber, Darwin. Won’t be long!`
`0x430036de`; `Great. And Juarez, you’re...`
`0x430036df`; `...Hold on... I think I'm about to experience a really close shave!`
`0x430036e0`; `Darwin, the scans here indicate that the robotic arms are made from some kind of strengthened alloy. You’ll have to use the Electro-Whip power attack to destroy them. That should shut down phase 1 of production.`
`0x430036e5`; `Great work Darwin - I’m showing you have the second phase of chip production stopped. Only one more to go.`
`0x430036e6`; `Okay - stay with me!`
`0x430036f5`; `Down to your last objective there, Darwin.`
`0x430036f6`; `Yeah, D... it’s showtime!`
`0x430036f7`; `The laser cutters are shielded by dampening equipment. You’ll have to deactivate them first. Once done you’ll need to use a high power beam to destroy them. Your Saberlizer will probably come in handy!`
`0x430036f8`; `It’s my new best friend...`
`0x430036f9`; `Darwin, just remember - you need to bring down the whole chip production operation before you leave.`
`0x430036fa`; `Chip production all destroyed. Gonna be impossible for Saber to put this mess back together..`
`0x430036fb`; `Next, you have to destroy the main generator. I'm still getting data on the layout there.`
`0x430036fc`; `Good - I’ll go there and get into position. Blaster, any news on Saber?`
`0x430036fd`; `Been tracking his signals. And I think I’m getting close.`
`0x430036fe`; `Close the deal, Blaster.`
`0x430036ff`; `Hey guys the machinery here is deactivated... got any quick ideas how I can get it working manually?`
`0x43003700`; `Come on D - this is old-school. You remember our cardio training, all those hours in the wheel? You just gotta start using your legs!`
`0x43003708`; `Okay team. I’ve activated that first turbine... moving onto number two, now.`
`0x43003709`; `Got a bit of problem here - the power core’s gone AWOL!`
`0x4300370a`; `You gotta fix that before the second turbine is good to go.`
`0x4300370b`; `Got it.`
`0x4300370c`; `Okay - good news - second turbine’s activated, and things are heating up!`
`0x4300370d`; `Darwin - we better plan your safe exfil before you start the last turbine.`
`0x4300370e`; `It’s going to get crazy hot in there, D. Me and Juarez got an idea. Though mostly it’s mine.`
`0x4300370f`; `Okay - I’m all ears.`
`0x43003710`; `When that system overheats it will trigger an emergency evac hatch to open. Once it does -`
`0x43003711`; `You jump out - and down, Darwin. Gonna be a big drop! Sounds like a blast!`
`0x43003712`; `And sounds like my only option.`
`0x43003715`; `All three turbines up and running, and the temp is shooting through the roof.`
`0x43003716`; `Right - and the emergency cooling system has kicked in Darwin;`
`0x43003717`; `Okay - the cooling system’s iced. Pretty sight. Wish you were here.`
`0x43003718`; `Attention... Power overload is imminent. Repeat. Power overload is imminent. Please evacuate this area immediately.`
`0x4300371b`; `Thanks for the warning…racing now!`
`0x4300371c`; `Darwin, I found Saber. He was just here... but he’s on the move again. Looks like we are not the only team getting close.`
`0x4300371d`; `The FBI? I’ll see if I can get video feed! Nice work, Furball!`
`0x4300371e`; `Darwin, remember you need to get the power core into the socket first.`
`0x430037da`; `Lock onto the socket by holding L2 and then press R2 to throw the core into it.`
`0x430038b9`; `Darwin - I’m getting extremely high radiation readings from that liquid.`
`0x430038ba`; `Confirmed. I’ll keep my paws out of it... don’t worry.`
`0x430038c9`; `You got to hurry, Darwin! Get back to the main assembly hub.`
`0x430038ca`; `I know. Any word from Speckles?`
`0x430038ce`; `Darwin, to get into the complex, make your way to the Main Assembly area. That conveyor should take you there, but you need to find some way of turning it on.`
`0x430038cf`; `Nice going D - those were some sweet moves!`
`0x430038d0`; `I've got a lock on Hurley's position. You need to use the Cargo Tram, it'll take you to him.`
`0x430038d1`; `You did it Darwin - you are amazing! The door's open!`
`0x430038f2`; `Darwin! I had the monorail schematics open and then... they just disappeared!`
`0x430038f3`; `Who... what just happened? I had the building layout on my headset... and it vanished! What’s going on?`
`0x430038f4`; `Darwin... this is very weird. I'm at the Computer Core. But it looks like... all the files have just been erased!`
`0x430038f5`; `Got to be Saber! The maniac’s anticipating every single move we make! And now he just wiped the plans off the core’s hard drive? Speckles, Juarez... keep looking for backup files.`
`0x430038f6`; `Will do.`
`0x430038f7`; `Of course I will, Darwin`
`0x430038f8`; `Juarez I've hacked into the first monorail. This baby’s going nowhere.`
`0x430038f9`; `Great - head to the second station. I'm still working on your route out.`
`0x430038fa`; `Got the elevator powered up.`
`0x430038fc`; `I’m approaching the third turbine now. Looks like it needs powering up too .`
`0x430038fd`; `Check around that level Darwin - there should be a Power Core generator nearby.`
`0x430039d5`; `Okay Darwin, I’m afraid you won’t be able to get through that door until the machinery below it is completely stopped. The only way to access the power core controlling it is through the air venting system... so guess it’s a job for Mooch.`

`0x43003b02`; `Good work Darwin, get to the activation lever and power up the second turbine.`
`0x43003b03`; `I have the final Power Core in place.`
`0x43003b04`; `Its going to get hot in there Darwin. Give that lever a pull.`
`0x43003bc2`; `Alright, Juarez. I’m at the production computer and you should be getting the factory plans now!`
`0x43003bc3`; `Coming though fine! Just stand by for another minute.`
`0x43003bc4`; `Looking at this... I see a plan. Best deal with the immediate threat first. Stop the shipping of the appliances... then their production. And after that... make sure that no more microchips get made.`
`0x43003bc5`; `Sounds good, Darwin.`
`0x43003bc6`; `Juarez, the button to stop the monorail is smashed. Can you find me another way?`
`0x43003bc7`; `Hold on... got one! You’ve got to get to the monorails themselves. Opening the access doors now.`
`0x43003bc8`; `You’re a star... making my way there now!`
`0x43003bcb`; `Nice... Okay, Juarez - both monorails shut down. No more shipments getting out of this plant. Tell me - have you gained access to the production facility?\n`
`0x43003bcc`; `Almost got it!`
`0x43003bcd`; `Good - gonna need that soon! Blaster, sit-rep amigo?`
`0x43003bce`; `I think I have a line on Saber, the man himself. Won’t be long, Darwin. He’s close!`
`0x43003bcf`; `Good work guys, Keep me updated! Speckles - you at the core yet?`
`0x43003bd0`; `Almost there, Darwin. And this time I think I can get the virus to work.`
`0x43003bd1`; `Darwin, I got it. I’m showing clear access to the production facility. I should be able to guide you straight through. But you better get moving - there may be heavy security backup.`
`0x43003bd9`; `Sorry-had a bit of distraction there.`
`0x43003bda`; `Found something interesting - the plans show a R&D lab in the east wing. Looks like they were working on some kind of magnetic grapple...`
`0x43003bdb`; `I could use that but I need you to hold position. Hurley - you’re going to have to get it for me.`
`0x43003bdc`; `Really? Me? My first G-Force mission!`
`0x43003bdd`; `Juarez, download the schematics to him... now get moving Hurley!`
`0x43003bde`; `And Darwin - I just hacked in and opened the door to the monorail control room!`
`0x43003bdf`; `Great work, Juarez!`
`0x43003be0`; `Er, Darwin... I found the grapple!`
`0x43003be1`; `Hey, not bad Hurley, not... bad. Now bring it right to me asap.`
`0x43003be2`; `Thanks Darwin... But I got, um, update. I’m having a bit of a problem here... Actually, I think it’s more than a bit... Help!!!`
`0x43003be3`; `Hurley... don’t move! I’ll get your position and get to you as fast as I can.`
`0x43003be4`; `Faster would be better! Not that I mean to rush you.`
`0x43003be5`; `Just hang in there, Hurley.`
`0x43003be6`; `Boy, am I glad to see you.`
`0x43003be7`; `Glad you’re okay too.`
`0x43003be8`; `Here you go...`
`0x43003be9`; `Now - get back to Juarez and fast. Unless you want to play some more with the waffle irons...`
`0x43003bea`; `Say no more amigo!`
`0x43003bf0`; `Now that was close. I almost became a part of the rinse cycle!`
`0x43003bf1`; `Glad you’re okay. You had us worried there.`
`0x43003bf2`; `I want to go on that ride, D! That had to be fun!`
`0x43003bf3`; ` You can do it next time, Blaster!`
`0x43003bf4`; `Good you made it through okay, Darwin. Where do you go now?`
`0x43003bf5`; `Now... on to the microchip production.`
`0x43003bf9`; `Juarez could you-`
`0x43003bfa`; `You read my mind. Thanks!`
`0x43003bfb`; `I just hope that door holds up!`
`0x43003bfc`; `That’s one angry shredder - but the reinforced glass is holding. Got some scientists inside and they’re cornered. Can you patch me into them?`
`0x43003bfd`; `Hold on... okay, they should hear you over the speaker.`
`0x43003bfe`; `Um, hello. This is Special Security Agent, er, Darwin. You okay in there?`
`0x43003bff`; `For now, yes. But we’re trapped!`
`0x43003c00`; `Thanks to your bright idea. You thought all this was a problem with my chips. We know different now don’t we...`
`0x43003c01`; `Okay... don't worry. I’ll get to a position where I can help. You two just hang tight.`
`0x43003c03`; `Er, hi. You okay in there?`
`0x43003c04`; `Agent Darwin? No, decidedly not ok, you could say "out of the frying pan into the fire"...`
`0x43003c05`; `They’re worse than pitbulls. Of course, he likes pitbulls!`
`0x43003c06`; `Um right - I hear you. I’m part of a team working on that. But can you tell me another way around this area? I can’t get through the airlock.`
`0x43003c07`; `Hmmm... No, there isn’t one - that airlock is the only way.`
`0x43003c08`; `Yeah... unless you re-route the pneumatic tubing to get past the airlock... but you'd have to be the size of a guinea pig to fit in that tube! Good luck with that!`
`0x43003c09`; `Um thanks...`
`0x43003c0b`; `Yes. Stay right there for now. I'll be sure to let... the SWAT team know that you're here.`
`0x43003c0c`; `Did you just-`
`0x43003c0d`; `What the...?`
`0x43003c0e`; `Um, I didn’t see it... if you didn’t!`
`0x43003c0f`; `Okay Juarez - got another problem here. I can’t access the third airlock. Any alternates?`
`0x43003c10`; `I can’t see another way. I think you best get to the security room and look for an alternate once you’re there.`
`0x43003c18`; `Everyone almost at the rendezvous point?`
`0x43003c19`; `Already there!`
`0x43003c1c`; `Blaster, time to get this thing racing. `
`0x43003c98`; `Should we - we stay here until someone stops these shredders?`
`0x43003ca1`; `Double time it, Darwin. The overload is happening faster than I calculated!`
`0x43003ca2`; `Moving out now!`
`0x43003ca6`; `Good. Heading back to the main chamber to take it out.`
`0x43003cbc`; `Alright, the first part of the chip production process has been totally trashed. Not bad...`
`0x43003cbd`; `Great-I have that second airlock open and all ready for you. Now onto the second production phase.`
`0x43003cbe`; `On my way now!`
`0x43003cbf`; `Okay... entering the primary generator sector now. How do we shut this monster down for good?`
`0x43003cc0`; `Here’s an idea. If you overload the generator you’ll send it into a meltdown state; that should do the trick.`
`0x43003cc1`; `Check me on this... the plans show three turbines feeding into the generator, right? So... If I get all of them running at once, the whole place will get mighty ‘hot’ and fast!`
`0x43003cc2`; `I’m not sure about that, Darwin. Could be too dangerous... you might not have enough time to get out of there. `
`0x43003cc3`; `You’ll need a speedy exfil for sure. I’ll get Blaster working on that now!`
`0x43003cc4`; `You know me! I'm all over it.`
`0x43003cc5`; `Don’t remind me.`
`0x43003cc6`; `Warning. Entering the machine processing area. Extreme danger ahead.`
`0x43003cc7`; `Woah-h. What just happened? I'm heading to machine processing.`
`0x43003cc8`; `Ready to rock n roll, D!`
`0x43003cc9`; `Yeeeehaaaa!!!`
`0x43003cca`; `Okay, I’m on my way to chip manufacturing.`
`0x43003d28`; `We’re gonna tear the house down, D!`
`0x43003d29`; `Darwin - you have to get into the depot offices. Then hack into one of the production computers to get the factory plans. Power up the conveyor belt - it’s the easiest way in.`
`0x43003d2a`; `I’m on it.`
`0x43003d2e`; `Can everyone give me an update?`
`0x43003d2f`; `Okay Darwin - I’m at Saber’s office and I have his laptop.`
`0x43003d30`; `Great work - see if you can hack in.`
`0x43003d31`; `Hey Juarez - send me an IM!`
`0x43003d32`; `Like ‘get lost’?`
`0x43003d33`; `Listen. I can help Juarez.`
`0x43003d34`; `What do you mean Speckles?`
`0x43003d35`; `If I can link Saber’s laptop to the Main Computer Core, we’ll have total access to Saber’s files.`
`0x43003d36`; `I know. Just wish me luck.`
`0x43003d37`; `Speckles - wait! Speckles?`
`0x43003d38`; `He’s gone, Darwin.`
`0x43003d39`; `Excellent. The office containing the plans is on the first floor.`
`0x43003d76`; `Um, you got it... nowhere to go anyway!`
`0x43003d77`; `Grapple’s gonna come in handy here.`
`0x43003d78`; `I'm here at the core, Darwin. Starting to work on the virus now.`
`0x43003d79`; `Great. We’re still on track to bring this place down... so let’s do it.`
`0x43003db9`; `Attention - Monorail One is now ready for departure. Station doors now opening.`
`0x43003dba`; `Attention: departure of all monorails has been cancelled.`
`0x43003dbb`; `Specks, I need a route through to the cargo hold.`
`0x43003dbc`; `The cargo lines can be reversed by switching the Power Cores. Try taking the Power Core out of one Socket and placing it in the other.`
`0x43003dbd`; `Remember Mooch can also handle those Power Cores.`
`0x43003dbe`; `Excellent work Darwin - you now have a free ride into the hold.`
`0x43003dbf`; `The monorail shipment for New York and all points east is now ready for departure.`
`0x43003dc0`; `Monorail two is now departing.`
`0x43003dc1`; `Attention-the monorail for destinations in Japan and China is now ready for loading.`
`0x43003dc2`; `Please be alert when nearing the loading docks.`
`0x43003dc3`; `All Monorails are now loaded and ready for departure.`
`0x43003dc4`; `Alert-the Monorail for all shipments to the Southern Hemisphere will be arriving in ten minutes and 29 seconds.`
`0x43003dc5`; `All Monorails at the loading docks will now commence loading procedures.`
`0x43003dc6`; `Wow, looks like production is in full swing, Saber sure has been busy.`
`0x43003dc7`; `It certainly is an impressive sight. You’re going to have to hitch a ride to the opposite side of this hanger - that should lead you directly into the main Storage Depot and subsequently those factory plans.`

`0x4300371f`; `Okay team. I’m outside, north wall. Big building. Got to get in and locate where they took our friend Mr. Leonard Saber. It’s only the FBI Headquarters... how hard could it be to break in?`
`0x43003722`; `And I'm, er, ready for my fill too!`
`0x43003723`; `Okay, let’s head to the video security room and see if we can get a fix on where they have Saber. Total radio silence in effect until we’re in - starting... now!`
`0x43003729`; `Hey, catch that, Juarez? The appliances just moved right past FBI Security, no problem. Saberling’s stuff must have total clearance here. But I sure don’t.`
`0x4300372a`; `Okay Darwin - sensors show Saber is way over at the other side of the building.`
`0x4300372b`; `Quickest way there?`
`0x4300372c`; `That would be through the forensic labs - but there might be heavy security.`
`0x4300372d`; `Blaster - gonna need your help ahead.`
`0x4300372e`; `You got it! I’m making my way there too!`
`0x43003730`; `You’ll never find Saber... my frosty friend is going to make sure of that!!! Ha ha ha!`
`0x43003731`; `That fridge froze over the entrance... and now I’m trapped. `
`0x43003732`; `I’ll activate the emergency over-ride, look for a lever to pull.`
`0x43003733`; `Will do. `
`0x43003734`; `That fridge has frozen the whole room. It’s like an ice rink here.`
`0x43003735`; `Yeah, everything’s iced solid here too. Talk about chillin' - colder than Juarez!`
`0x43003738`; `Juarez, Blaster... bad news. I've reached the forensic labs but they’re locked. Any alternates?`
`0x43003739`; `I’m checking! `
`0x4300373a`; `I can’t do anything from here to get that door open. You’ll have to find another way in. Maybe you can get outside the building from the Director’s office.`
`0x4300373b`; `You mean go... out of the building?`
`0x4300373c`; `Just be glad you have your jetpack, Darwin!`
`0x4300373d`; `Whoa - The refrigerator has blocked the vacuum in the closet with a wall of ice!`
`0x4300373e`; `Darwin, I think you will have to free the vacuum.`
`0x4300373f`; `What?`
`0x43003740`; `The security door there will open only for a Saberling appliance.`
`0x43003741`; `So time to do some vacuuming, huh? Blaster - sit rep?`
`0x43003742`; `I'm at the forensics lab elevator... with a lot of nasty company! Only out-numbered 5 to 1... so I have the advantage!`
`0x43003743`; `Stay safe!`
`0x43003744`; `Ugh. You guys picking this up? Is that the ugliest cat you’ve ever seen or what?`
`0x43003745`; `All cats are ugly. And that sound they make? Me-ow? What is with that?`
`0x43003746`; `Why anyone would hang a picture of cat...`
`0x43003747`; `Blaster - any ideas on getting to the other side of the building?`
`0x43003748`; `Yeah, you got to get to the top of that ledge above you... then zip line across. I should be able to give you a bit of boost with the elevator.`
`0x43003749`; `More heights? Great...`
`0x4300374a`; `Come on Darwin - this is fun!`
`0x4300374b`; `Okay, Blaster - going up!`
`0x4300374c`; `You’re on your way, Darwin. Next floor - sporting goods and swim wear.`
`0x43003755`; `I’m at the door - but it has a keycard lock. `
`0x43003756`; `Then there has to be a keycard nearby. Maybe check the supply offices?`
`0x43003757`; `Juarez - any update?`
`0x43003758`; `Nothing on Saber’s location. But I have an idea. If we can uplink your IR equipment to the building's security, I should be able to triangulate the location of the real Saber.`
`0x43003759`; `Good work - so what do I do?`
`0x4300375a`; `That’s the hard part. You must get to the nearest Security Uplink station... and that’s inside the bureau’s High Tech Crimes division. Probably has a high security door... and no telling what else you’ll face.`
`0x4300375b`; `Other than that... it’s a walk in the park.`
`0x4300375c`; `Darwin, there's one mean paper shredder guarding the door ahead. But I think I have a way you can get past it.`
`0x4300375d`; `And that is?`
`0x4300375e`; `Okay, there’s one of those Holo-Scanners right near you. It’ll make a Holo-disc version of you, Darwin. Throw it in front of those crazy appliances and they’ll ignore you completely. As long as your clone keeps running, should work like a charm!`
`0x4300375f`; `Blaster... sometimes you are absolutely brilliant.`
`0x43003760`; `What do you mean only sometimes? Good luck Darwin!`
`0x43003761`; `Juarez, it’s getting really cold here.`
`0x43003762`; `Something’s wrong with the cooling system.`
`0x43003763`; `Do you know a way to...`
`0x43003764`; `Oh, a little cold, and you with all that nice warm fur. My toys have been playing with the cooling system. I'm afraid it’s going to get even colder. You better keep moving, guinea pig.`
`0x43003765`; `Juarez, I reached the High tech Crimes division. But I’m going to need a keycard to access the area.`
`0x43003766`; `There’s a security booth in the next room, they’ll have one, but you’ll need to use the terminal to get in there. Any motion sensors around?`
`0x43003767`; `I see one... Bet I can use it to get the power up and running.`
`0x43003768`; `But Darwin - there’s no direct line of sight. You’ll have to bend or bounce the beams. Won't be easy.`
`0x43003769`; `Juarez, nothing’s been easy today.`
`0x4300376c`; `Okay Darwin, the Security Uplink station should be just there, right to your...`
`0x4300376d`; `You two are getting so tiresome. You see, I can not lose this game, not now. Mr Saber is completely cornered by my machines. Do not worry. When they get to him... it will all be quite quick!`
`0x4300376e`; `Keep talking, Yanshu. Sounds like you're the one who’s starting to worry!`
`0x4300376f`; `Juarez. I’ve got my IR system uplinked to Security.`
`0x43003770`; `Great. Hold on... there. Got Saber! He's not far away... only two floors down. I've opened the office so you can get in. But you’ll have to go outside again to get to him in time.`
`0x43003771`; `Outside? Blaster - you there? I was hoping you had a handy vent I could use.`
`0x43003772`; `Sorry D... no vents near you. Go on out there... you know you love it!`
`0x43003773`; `Riiiight!...`
`0x43003774`; `Darwin - good work. Saber is located in one of the elevators just a few floors above you. If you get into the adjacent elevator I should be able to patch your comms directly to him.`
`0x43003775`; `Good! Blaster, report?`
`0x43003776`; `Checking for alternates in the area Darwin. If there are any other ways in or out... I’ll find them!`
`0x43003777`; `Keep me posted!`
`0x43003778`; `So Darwin, leader of the great G-Force... I must say you are very persistent. Unfortunately you are coming to the end of this trail, very soon.`
`0x43003779`; `No Yanshu, not the end of the trail... the end of you.`
`0x4300377a`; `How vexing. Thought for sure the firing range would stop you cold. No matter, everything is locked up tight and you can expect company... right about... now!`
`0x4300377b`; `Impressive. And I do not impress easily. I must admit you are dealing admirably with every test I throw your way.`
`0x43003780`; `Such dogged persistence. All wasted. What a pity.`
`0x43003781`; `I'm closing in, Yanshu. You’re just about done here...`
`0x43003782`; `Not exactly... I’m afraid the ending won’t be what you expect.`
`0x43003783`; `Oh, really - will it be even better? `
`0x43003784`; `Goodbye, Rodent!`
`0x43003785`; `Juarez, Yanshu has sabotaged the elevator controls.`
`0x43003786`; `Any ideas?`
`0x43003787`; `Got one. I could get on top of the elevator and get it moving somehow.`
`0x43003788`; `Hey, pret-ty amazing... I actually got the elevator moving.`
`0x43003789`; `Good - patching you into Saber’s elevator. Get him to go to the ground floor stat!`
`0x4300378a`; `Mr. Saber - FBI here. I'm going to free your elevator. Then take it down to the...`
`0x4300378b`; `Er, yes - take the elevator to the roof, Mr. Saber - and hurry!`
`0x4300378c`; `Juarez, who is that? That sounds like.. that sounds like me talking to Saber!`
`0x4300378d`; `We will have a chopper all ready to take you to safety, Mr. Saber.`
`0x4300378e`; `Someone in the building has stolen the feed - and they have digitally copied your voice!`
`0x4300378f`; `Yanshu’s going down hard! Can you crack into it?`
`0x43003790`; `Afraid not. It’s heavily encrypted.`
`0x43003919`; `I’m at the elevator - but the control terminal’s offline.`
`0x4300391a`; `All secure terminals shut down if a security breach is detected.`
`0x4300391b`; `Great - so we need to get power to this system somehow?`
`0x4300391c`; `Yes, the energy from a motion sensor beam may work, be careful though.`
`0x4300391d`; `Darwin, you’ll need to attract the motion sensor beam and then get it to hit the optic switch.`
`0x4300391e`; `Saber's gone, Darwin!`
`0x4300391f`; `Looks like someone doesn’t want him to talk.`
`0x43003920`; `He said ‘Yanshu’...`
`0x43003921`; `Yanshu... right, Saber’s mysterious partner. Keep trying to track Saber. We need answers. `
`0x43003923`; `But why should we work against each other? Do you really care about those who treat you so poorly? Just think of the havoc we could reap together. Humanity wouldn’t know what hit it.`
`0x43003924`; `Such bravado. Beware of surprises, little guinea pig. I gave you a chance. And I’m afraid it was a one-time offer.`
`0x43003925`; `Juarez I’ve located the elevators - but my access here is all iced up.`
`0x43003926`; `Hold on, okay... head into the restrooms... yes, the restrooms. There’s a route there that will take you into the maintenance area and loop you back to the elevators.`
`0x43003927`; `Gracias Juarez, heading back now!`
`0x43003931`; `Saber’s trapped on the Helicopter pad, and it looks suspiciously quiet.`
`0x43003932`; `Darwin, hold fire till we get there.`
`0x43003933`; `I don’t think we have time... wish me luck guys.`
`0x43003936`; `Darwin, that looks like one cool ride - you get all the best assignments!`
`0x43003937`; `Yeah, sure Blaster... I am soooo lucky. Juarez, anything from Specks yet?`
`0x43003a67`; `Darwin, my scans indicate a data disk for a prototype Flame Thrower weapon in this area. You’re gonna need this if we’re going to get to Saber... `
`0x43003abf`; `That door... I can't get access, my guess is that the mechanism is broken.`
`0x43003ac0`; `I’ll have to find some other way through...`
`0x43003b44`; `Only for you, Blaster.`
`0x43003b45`; `Ditto!`
`0x43003b46`; `Nothing yet.`
`0x43003c22`; `Okay - there’s the control room and there's the guard... and that’s a problem!`
`0x43003c23`; `Hey, Hurley, think you can do something to get the guard to come out?`
`0x43003c24`; `You just watch!`
`0x43003c25`; `Yoo-hoo.`
`0x43003c26`; `What the?`
`0x43003c27`; `What’s up?`
`0x43003c28`; `You gotta be kidding!`
`0x43003c29`; `It’s me again!`
`0x43003c2a`; `That’s just wrong!`
`0x43003c2b`; `Security, you're not going to believe this... but we got a rodent problem down here in Sector 4B. I’m going to investigate it now!`
`0x43003c2c`; `Juarez, hack into this system and find Saber.`
`0x43003c2d`; `Count on it.`
`0x43003c2e`; `Got him! There's Saber!`
`0x43003c2f`; `I tell you - I don't know what has happened.`
`0x43003c30`; `Just tell us how to make those waffle irons and toasters stop attacking everyone.`
`0x43003c31`; `I keep telling you. I don't know. Unless... unless...`
`0x43003c32`; `Unless... it was Yanshu. He could...`
`0x43003c33`; `Enough from you, Mr. Saber. Time to bring our working relationship to an end.`
`0x43003c34`; `Who is this? Identify yourself.`
`0x43003c35`; `Why don’t I show you instead...?`
`0x43003c36`; `Evac! Go... go... go! Everyone out of here now!`
`0x43003c37`; `Juarez... I... I see Saber!`
`0x43003c38`; `Hold on, Darwin. I'm getting some funny readings. Not sure that-`
`0x43003c39`; `I don’t suppose you want to surrender? Do not worry, I have Mr Saber’s retirement plan all worked out! Though I’m afraid it won’t be much fun for him!`
`0x43003c3d`; `Ready to give up, Rodent? If not, I have more surprises... all ready and waiting just for you.`
`0x43003c3e`; `I'm afraid your new toy won't help you much.`
`0x43003c3f`; `Guys - got a big problem here.`
`0x43003c40`; `Trapped like a rat. It's the fate you chose, Darwin.`
`0x43003c41`; `Juarez, I freed Saber's elevator. Mr. Saber, Mr. Saber! Can you hear me. You must head to the ground-`
`0x43003c42`; `Mr. Saber, don't listen to that impostor’s voice above you. Get to the roof as fast as you can.`
`0x43003c43`; `No. Mr. Saber, trust me. That's Yanshu speaking! You must get to the ground floor!`
`0x43003c44`; `That’s a trap Mr. Saber... don’t listen to him! A chopper is flying to the roof now!`
`0x43003c45`; `There is no chopper, Mr. Saber... don’t do it!`
`0x43003c46`; `Enough! I... I'm heading to the roof... now! Tell the chopper I’m coming!`
`0x43003c47`; `There’s Saber! He’s walking right into a trap!`
`0x43003c48`; `Wh... what’s going on...?`
`0x43003c49`; `Okay, listen Mr. Saber... you’re safe now. Tell me: how do we stop SaberSense?`
`0x43003c4a`; `Th... this isn’t SaberSense, not the way it was supposed to be. Yanshu twisted everything.`
`0x43003c4b`; `But how do we stop it?`
`0x43003c4c`; `Only by destroying the SaberSense satellite communications... at my complex.`
`0x43003c4d`; `And that will stop SaberSense worldwide?`
`0x43003c4e`; `Yes! Wh... where are you?`
`0x43003c4f`; `Don’t worry... you just wait there. Agents are on their way.`
`0x43003c50`; `G-Force... time to rendezvous and finish SaberSense off once and for all.`
`0x43003c51`; `Darwin. I got a fix on Yanshu’s signal. He’s in the satellite center itself! `
`0x43003c52`; `Finally we get to meet the mysterious Yanshu... face to face...`
`0x43003c53`; `Ah welcome guinea pig. And welcome to my small surprise. A final trap. Nowhere to go, for you or Saber. And all my pets... so eager to play.`
`0x43003c54`; `Time to give up, Darwin. Oops - so sorry. The time for ‘giving up’ has passed. Nothing you can do now, I am afraid... nothing at all.`
`0x43003c55`; `You’re sounding a bit desperate, Yanshu? Getting worried?`
`0x43003c56`; `Don’t you wish. I have it planned down to every detail.`
`0x43003c57`; `Good. I just love wrecking plans.`
`0x43003c58`; `Oh, but this time you are all part of that plan. If only you knew, you simple-minded rodent.`
`0x43003c59`; `Simple minded rodent? Yanshu - you have no idea who I am... but get ready to find out!`
`0x43003c5a`; `Oh, what is it your type always says... bring it on!`
`0x43003c5b`; `You’re out matched - you can’t hurt that microwave! It’s all over.`
`0x43003c5c`; `It’s over when I say it is. I’m just getting started...`
`0x43003c5d`; `The microwave shell is way too tough for your weapons, Darwin. There has to be another way of bringing it down.`
`0x43003c5e`; `Wait... if you can get something inside the microwave, it may find it hard to swallow.`
`0x43003c5f`; `Try this... throw a power core right into the microwave when it opens its door - the reaction should be enough to blow it up from the inside. Worth a shot!`
`0x43003ca3`; `Let’s find that nutcase, D!`
`0x43003ca4`; `Ready for the infil.`
`0x43003ca5`; `Least you know what floor he's on. Good hunting!`
`0x43003ca7`; `Maybe you can use that? Darwin - not to worry you, but haven’t had an update from Speckles in a while.`
`0x43003ca8`; `If I know Specks he’s lost himself to figuring out how to bring down Saber’s computer. I'm moving on...`
`0x43003d25`; `A partnership. With you, Yanshu? You’re talking to the wrong mammal. You’re going down.`
`0x43003d26`; `Give it a shot, Darwin! By the way, still trying to get a signal from Speckles. So far nothing.`
`0x43003d27`; `Keep trying....`
`0x43003d63`; `Great work Darwin. The Flame Thrower will make light work of all the ice around here. Now get the keycard.`
`0x43003d64`; `Got the data disk. Heading to a kiosk now - then we can start warming this party up!`
`0x43003d65`; `Roger Darwin.`
`0x43003daa`; `Attention... emergency exit opening.`

`0x43003833`; `Something is making so-called space ‘junk’ fall to Earth. Authorities are warning everyone to stay inside, and to—`
`0x43003834`; `You getting this? It’s coming right at us. It’s gonna hit here—run!`
`0x43003835`; `Well -- a guest come to visit…come on in, Darwin. I do think it is time we met…face…to face. You do like surprises, don't you?`
`0x43003836`; `Speckles. No, you can’t be—`
`0x43003837`; `Yanshu, oh yes I can be. The mysterious Yanshu who unleashed the horror of Sabersense. One—and the same.`
`0x43003838`; `But why?`
`0x43003839`; `Have you ever searched on the net for the word ‘mole’, Darwin…There’s thousands of pages showing how to trap them…how to kill them. Guess what? Now it’s humanity’s turn.`
`0x4300383a`; `I can’t let you do this, Speckles.`
`0x4300383b`; `You…can’t? You still think you can stop me? Too bad , Darwin. You have picked your side. You will stand…and perish with them!`
`0x4300383c`; `It all begins….now`
`0x43003840`; `Juarez. You getting my video feed? And Blaster, can you see this?  `
`0x43003841`; `I see it nice and clear, Darwin. Looks like a data disk.`
`0x43003842`; `If it’s here, under all this high security there must be a reason. Juarez, any ideas?`
`0x43003843`; `I’m sending the signal direct to Ben... he might know what it is. But you’re right. If it’s here, it must be important.`
`0x43003844`; `The NanoHacker is based on the same tech as the Saberlizer. It uses nanotechnology to temporarily infect the targeting circuits of the SaberSense chip... and... makes the appliances attack each other! `
`0x43003845`; `Then that’s going to be one mighty useful gadget.`
`0x43003846`; `Darwin, be careful. I can't be sure what it will do. You’re going to have to try it and see what it does to each enemy.`
`0x43003847`; `Darwin, you have a good opportunity here to test the upgraded NanoHacker. Take a shot at one of the vacuums... and see what it does.`
`0x4300384a`; `O-kay. Here goes nothing...`
`0x4300384b`; `There you go, Darwin! Now you should be able to get past all the vacuums. Okay, keep the NanoHacker ready... and you know I bet the pressure from the nozzle is powerful enough to propel you into the air if you need it!`
`0x4300384c`; `Just an idea, Darwin... but I bet a projectile fired from the vacuum might help you get out of there and to the exit fast. Worth - as they say - a shot.`
`0x4300384d`; `You do get some wild ideas... I’ll try it`
`0x4300384e`; `Juarez... the code to open the door has to be on one of these computers... but something has made them go crazy. The data’s just flying by too fast to read.`
`0x4300384f`; `How about you use Mooch! He sees the world a lot slower then the rest of us. He should be able to read the combination.`
`0x43003850`; `Great idea. Thanks!`
`0x43003851`; `Darwin, we have to shut down the satellite control center fast. There should be a computer terminal up ahead that’s linked to the CCTV. I’m picking up lifeform readings - it’s the scientists from the chip production facility.`
`0x43003852`; `I’ll see what they have to say.`
`0x43003860`; `Okay, Juarez. I’ve reached the communication control. But I’ve got to get up to the satellite dishes... What’s the best way forward?`
`0x43003861`; `There’s gotta be a door controlled by a keycard in that room. Just activate it and ride the elevator.`
`0x43003862`; `Thanks! Couldn’t do this without you. `
`0x43003863`; `Juarez... Yanshu is doing a better than good job of keeping me away from those sat dishes. In other words... I'm trapped. Any ideas, guys?`
`0x43003864`; `Hey D, the NanoHacker might be ideal for this situation! Try it out and see what happens! `
`0x43003865`; `Great plan, Blaster. I’ll do just that!`
`0x4300386c`; `Heading to the satellite complex now. How we doing team? `
`0x4300386d`; `Making progress on Yanshu’s signal!`
`0x4300386e`; `And I'm keeping all the exfils clear, Mr. D!`
`0x4300386f`; `And I’m standing by too, Darwin.`
`0x43003872`; `Juarez, I’m in the control room now. Guess what? The power is off. Getting to this dish isn’t going to be as easy as planned `
`0x43003873`; `Okay, I’ve found the generator for the control room. But I'm going to need some power cores to get it running again. Juarez, can you do a scan?`
`0x43003874`; `Doing it now... okay... got ‘em. They’re nearby. I've marked their location on your mission computer. `
`0x43003875`; `Thanks - I’ll start looking now!`
`0x43003876`; `Juarez, you got an image of this door? It has a button combination. Can you help?`
`0x43003877`; `Sorry, D... My guess is the codes are auto-generated by the consoles, and routed to anyone cleared for access. Which definitely isn't you. You’ll have to get to a console and hack it for the code.`
`0x43003878`; `Got it.`
`0x43003879`; `Whoa. I've hacked in but the codes are flying by too fast for me to see.`
`0x4300387a`; `Okay. I’ve got the last power core. Time to see if this gets the area on-line, and I can access that last dish.`
`0x4300387b`; `Darwin... looks like it worked. Energy readings are at full strength!`
`0x4300387c`; `Then I’m heading back to the control room.`
`0x4300387d`; `You should be able to get access to the satellite dish using the central console. Good luck!`
`0x4300387e`; `Whoa - you guys see the size of this dish? A lot bigger than I thought.`
`0x4300387f`; `The bigger they are, D.`
`0x43003880`; `Any ideas on how to bring it down?`
`0x43003882`; `Confirmed. I can see them from here. Anything else?`
`0x43003883`; `Darwin, once you remove them... it will start shutting down. But you better find a way to destroy the main dish in case Yanshu reactivates it.`
`0x43003884`; `Got it. I've learned to always expect the unexpected with Yanshu.`
`0x43003885`; `I don’t know what you’ll face Darwin -- take care.`
`0x43003886`; `That goes for me too D. You’ve come this far—time to finish it!`
`0x43003887`; `Nice one Darwin! One down, and one to go. Now head over to the opposite side of the control area.`
`0x43003888`; `On my way!`
`0x43003889`; `Satellite link-up shutting down. Please stand clear.`
`0x4300388a`; `Great work! Now climb up onto the main dish and destroy the three energy pylons.`
`0x4300388b`; `We’ve come this far... time to finish it`
`0x4300388c`; `You persistent and irritating rodent. You just won't give up, will you? But no matter - surely you have guessed that I have backups that make everything you do useless! And you certainly won’t guess what's about to happen next!`
`0x4300388d`; `Next? Blaster, Juarez... do you have any idea what that maniac Yanshu is talking about?`
`0x4300388e`; `The fool’s just bluffin’`
`0x4300388f`; `No idea - but you hurry outta there! The emergency hatch down there is your quickest route back to the central elevator.`
`0x43003891`; `Darwin... wait! I'm getting a reading that Yanshu is right there... at your location!`
`0x4300392b`; `Good idea, Juarez…I’ll need all the help I can get. Keep me posted!`
`0x4300392c`; `Are you sure about this? `
`0x4300392d`; `Glad I was right. The vacuum’s safe now so you should be able to take over its controls. Try going close to it, go ahead.`
`0x43003c65`; `Did you see what those Saberling appliances are doing? Crazy, huh?`
`0x43003c66`; `I wouldn’t want to be a shareholder in Saberling after this, they’ll... `
`0x43003c67`; `Wait! Look up there! Something in the sky, meteors or...`
`0x43003c68`; `Jeff! Come here quick... the news is showing things... falling from space.`
`0x43003c6a`; `Whoa, this is cool. And what is this stuff that's falling...? "space junk"?`
`0x43003c6b`; `Hey. Can you hear me? `
`0x43003c6c`; `Who is that? `
`0x43003c6d`; `Oh um. I‘m with a special unit called, um, G-Force. I could use some help here... like, how do I shut down this control center, and fast? `
`0x43003c6e`; `G-Force eh? You sound awfully familiar... `
`0x43003c6f`; `Clock’s ticking guys...`
`0x43003c70`; `OK! Here's what you do... disable the main satellite dish that the Saberling network uses to control the appliances worldwide. Once you do that, we can shut down that entire wing of the building. And that... should end this madness.`
`0x43003c71`; `We'll send you a keycard now so you can open the door in there. Good luck.`
`0x43003c72`; `A.. are you sure that’s a good idea, Elaine? I mean, what if it’s intercepted?`
`0x43003c73`; `Intercepted? It won't be intercepted! You are such a worrier! Alright, G-Force man, get ready! `
`0x43003c74`; `Darwin—wait---I'm getting a reading that Yanshu is right there…at your location!`
`0x43003c75`; `Well... a guest come to visit... leaving so soon Darwin? I do think it is time we met... face... to face. You do like surprises, don't you?`
`0x43003c76`; `Speckles. No, you can’t be?`
`0x43003c77`; `Yanshu, oh yes I can be. The mysterious Yanshu who unleashed the horror of SaberSense. One... and the same.`
`0x43003c78`; `But why?`
`0x43003c79`; `Have you ever searched on the net for the word "mole", Darwin? There’s thousands of pages showing how to trap them... how to kill them. Guess what? Now it’s humanity’s turn!`
`0x43003c7a`; `I can’t let you do this, Speckles.`
`0x43003c7b`; `You... can’t? You still think you can stop me? Too bad, Darwin. You have picked your side. You will stand... and perish with them!`
`0x43003c7c`; `It all begins... now`
`0x43003c7d`; `What in the...`
`0x43003c7e`; `We've got to move fast. Everyone... ideas!`
`0x43003c7f`; `Scanning the thing now. It’s made up of Saberling appliances! Got to get into the very core of it... to have even a chance of bringing it down.`
`0x43003c80`; `No way! How can we do that? That thing’s massive. You’d need a plane to get to it!`
`0x43003c81`; `Right. Only one way to get to it. Mooch, old buddy... we got to send you in there. It’s down to you.`
`0x43003cb3`; `Good. Let’s wrap this mission up!`
`0x43003cb4`; `Darwin remember those vacuums can be NanoHacked and they’re tied in to the building’s security. Could be useful!`
`0x43003cb5`; `I wonder if they’re also good for cleaning rugs?`
`0x43003cb6`; `I wouldn’t know that... unless you count Blaster as a rug...`
`0x43003cb7`; `Hey... you said that would remain between us!`
`0x43003cb8`; `I did say sorry!`
`0x43003ccf`; `Last act, guys. I’ve reached the satellite complex basement. Sit-rep?`
`0x43003cd0`; `Scanning the satellite complex for Yanshu’s signal. Closing in on it. I am also picking up high power readings from the basement area - this could be worth investigating before you enter the complex .`
`0x43003cd1`; `I'm a little busy playing with some evil toasters here... but don’t worry - I’ll get to your position soon!`
`0x43003cd2`; `The schematics indicate that you will have to enter the complex via the lower access doors. I will mark them on your mission computer. `
`0x43003cd3`; `Thanks Ben and... I'm heading in now...`
`0x43003d6d`; `Just got some intel from the Saberling database... The schematics show that the dish is controlled by two power cores at the base of the pillar.`
`0x43003d7c`; `I have the disk, it looks like plans for some sort of weapon upgrade.`
`0x43003d7d`; `Sounds interesting. Buy it and we'll take a closer look.`
`0x43003d7e`; `I’m on it.`
`0x43003d7f`; `The upgrade to the nanotechnology allows the NanoHacker to infect the targeting circuits of invulnerable enemies.`
`0x43003d80`; `Thanks for the intel Ben. With all these vacuums around here it’s gonna be my new best friend...`
`0x43003d81`; `Darwin, get that upgrade and lets see what it is capable of.`
`0x43003d82`; `Have you got the upgrade for the NanoHacker yet Darwin? It could prove to be useful. `
`0x43003dad`; `That’s got it! Now you’ll need to lower the access ladder to reach the top of the dish, although I’m pretty sure Yanshu’s not going to make this easy...`
`0x43003dae`; `Agreed, it’s way too quiet out there. I see a way to get at it. If I can make this quick, maybe I’ll beat him to the punch.`
`0x43003fd8`; `Security Code`
`0x43003fe3`; `...so called "space junk" falling to earth. I believe we can go to some amateur footage...`
`0x43003fe4`; `Oh man – they're heading straight for us. They're gonna hit! Come on... lets get outta here!`
`0x43004022`; `Heading into the satellite control room now. How we doing team? `
`0x43004023`; `I don’t think so Darwin. It’s time for you to witness the true power of my ultimate creation...`
`0x43004024`; `Yanshu!`

`0x43003892`; `Mooch, my man - it’s all up to you now...`
`0x43003893`; `Mooch... you’ll have to get into the central core. It’s the only way we’ll have any chance of stopping this thing.`
`0x43003895`; `Okay Mooch—you have to insert the PDA right into the heart of Clusterstorm. Once you do—I can remotely trigger the virus upload from here.`
`0x43003896`; `It’s all up to you now Mooch!`
`0x43003897`; `Juarez... Mooch has overloaded the core! `
`0x43003898`; `I’m hacking in now. Keep your fingers crossed! Mooch - hustle out of there pronto!`
`0x430039da`; `Mooch, those things are out to destroy the cores! You have to stop them fast!`
`0x430039e1`; `Mooch... Okay, fill those power core sockets to overload the core. That should disable Clusterstorm’s defenses so we can control the satellite.`
`0x430039e2`; `And if we control the satellite, we can use it to destroy Clusterstorm. It’s down to you, Mooch! `
`0x430039e3`; `Gaahh, what’s this... a fly in the ointment? Nothing I can't swat. `
`0x430039e4`; `Great work Mooch! Get out of there pronto, were adjusting the satellites now!`
`0x43003b13`; `Yeah! Go for it little buddy!`
`0x43003b14`; `I’m ready to target Clusterstorm.`
`0x43003b15`; `Bring it down, D!`
`0x43003b16`; `Great work, Mooch... keep it up! `
`0x43003b17`; `I'm starting to get elevated energy readings, Mooch. You must be getting closer to the core!`
`0x43003b18`; `Careful, looks like a minefield ahead. You should be able to detonate those devices with the interference beam.`
`0x43003b19`; `Way to go,Mooch!`
`0x43003b1a`; `I’m reading a massive energy signature just ahead. Mooch, that must be the core! You’re close!`
`0x43003c82`; `What? How could you do that, only I - no it’s all... all... Aggghhhhhh...`
`0x43003c83`; `I still can’t believe it was Speckles all along...`
`0x43003c84`; `And you stopped him, Darwin!`
`0x43003c85`; `No Blaster. Speckles did it to himself.`

`0x430039f3`; `That’s one nasty roadblock ahead - watch those shredders! `
`0x430039f5`; `Getting a news feed coming through, patching it in...`

`0x430039fa`; `I’m all set guys!`
`0x430039fb`; `Okay, G-Force – I've got a plan. We have to hit the distribution area first... and stop any more of these things from getting out. Then once that's done, we can take down the production plant.`
`0x430039fc`; `And Hurley... I gonna need you to hold position in the RDV... and keep watch `
`0x430039fd`; `Darwin, I must disagree with this plan of action. It's a clear breach of protocol. We should all focus on finding Saber. Ben, are you on the line?`
`0x430039fe`; `I'm here, Speckles.`
`0x430039ff`; `We should stay together until we understand the situation better. If I can get-`
`0x43003a00`; `No, no time for that, Speckles. Darwin - Speckles is right. It breaks protocol. But you’ve got a 'go' for your infil. Darwin, stop the chip production. Everyone \nelse - find Saber!\n`

`0x43003a05`; `I would suggest that ‘thinking’ is probably not your forte. Or speaking for that matter`
`0x43003a06`; `Okay, okay. Everyone, to your positions. Ready... to disengage... now!`
`0x43003bbf`; `Let’s get outta here, D!`
`0x43003bc0`; `And stay close!`
`0x43003bc1`; `I think we shook them off. Okay, everyone regroup and then we better figure out what just happened back there...`
`0x430037dd`; `Darwin - I'm getting a video feed. Saber’s leaving the complex... in the company of the FBI.`
`0x430037de`; `The Feds got him before I did? Man!`
`0x430039f1`; `What? Heading down! `
`0x430039f2`; `Now this is fast!`
`0x43003a07`; `G-Force, then they’ll be taking him to FBI HQ.`
`0x43003a08`; `Dangerous as it is, we got to get in there and find out what Saber tells them... It’s the only way to stop this.`
